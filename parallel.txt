It happened in the days when the judges judged ,  that there was a famine in the land .  A certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to live in the country of Moab ,  he ,  and his wife ,  and his two sons .	Rorêltuten ro an rêl lai khân ,  Israel ramah ṭâm a tla a .  Judai ram Bethlehem khuaa mi pakhat chu a nupui leh a fapa pahnih nên Moab ramah ṭâm tlân tûrin an kal a .  
The name of the man was Elimelech ,  and the name of his wife Naomi ,  and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion ,  Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah .  They came into the country of Moab ,  and continued there .	Chu mi hming chu Elimeleka a ni a ,  a nupui hming chu Naomi a ni ;  an fate hming chu Mahlona leh Kiliona a ni .  Judai ram Bethlehem khuaa Efrata mi an ni .  Moab ramah chuan an kal a ,  chutah chuan an awm ta reng a .  
Elimelech ,  Naomi ' s husband ,  died ;  and she was left ,  and her two sons . 	Naomi pasal Elimeleka chu a thi a ;  tichuan ,  Naomi chu a fapa pahnihte nên chauh an awm ta a .  
They took them wives of the women of Moab ;  the name of the one was Orpah ,  and the name of the other Ruth :  and they lived there about ten years . 	A fate chuan Moab mi nupuiah an nei a ,  pakhat hming chu Orpi a ni a ,  a dang hming chu Ruthi a ni .  Chuta kum sâwm lai an awm hnu chuan 
Mahlon and Chilion both died ,  and the woman was bereaved of her two children and of her husband . 	Mahlona leh Kiliona chu an thi ve leh ta a ,  chu nu chu a pasal leh a fapate chuan an thihsan ve leh ta a .  
Then she arose with her daughters - in - law ,  that she might return from the country of Moab :  for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread .	Tin ,  Lalpa chuan a mite a ṭanpui a ,  ei tûr a pe tih Moab ram aṭang chuan an lo hria a ,  a mote nên chuan Moab ram ata haw tûrin an insiam ta a .  
She went forth out of the place where she was ,  and her two daughters - in - law with her ;  and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah . 	A mo pahnih nên chuan an awmna hmun chhuahsanin Judai ram an pan ta a .  
Naomi said to her two daughters - in - law ,   " Go ,  return each of you to her mother ' s house :  Yahweh deal kindly with you ,  as you have dealt with the dead ,  and with me . 	Nakinah chuan Naomi chuan a mo pahnihte hnênah chuan ,    “  In nute in lamah haw ve ve zâwk rawh u ,  ka chungah leh in pasal thi tate chunga khawngaihna in lantîr ang khân ,  Lalpa chuan khawngaih che u rawh se .  
Yahweh grant you that you may find rest ,  each of you in the house of her husband .  "  Then she kissed them ,  and they lifted up their voice ,  and wept . 	Lalpan in pahnihin thlamuang taka pasal te hmua in awm theih nân khawngaih che u rawh se , ” a ti a .  Anni chu a fâwp a ,  râwl chhuah meuhvin an ṭap ta a .  
They said to her ,   " No ,  but we will return with you to your people .  " 	A mote chuan ,    “  Kan haw lo vang ,  i mite hnêna i kal tûr hi kan zui ve zâwk ang che , ” an ti a .  
Naomi said ,   " Go back ,  my daughters .  Why do you want to go with me  ?   Do I still have sons in my womb ,  that they may be your husbands  ?  	Naomi chuan ,    “  Ka fanute u ,  haw zâwk rawh u .  Engah nge ka hnênah chuan in kal ve kher ang  ?   In pasal tûr fapa ka nei leh thei dâwn em ni  ?   
Go back ,  my daughters ,  go your way ;  for I am too old to have a husband .  If I should say ,   ' I have hope ,  '  if I should even have a husband tonight ,  and should also bear sons ; 	Ka fanute u ,  in in lamah haw leh rawh u .  Pasal han nei tûrin ka upa lutuk tawh si a ,   ‘ ka bei a la sei reng e , ’ tiin zâninah pawh hian pasal neiin fapa te pawh han nei tehrêng ila ,  
would you then wait until they were grown  ?   Would you then refrain from having husbands  ?   No ,  my daughters ,  for it grieves me much for your sakes ,  for the hand of Yahweh has gone out against me .  " 	an puitlin thlengin in nghâk dâwn em ni ang  ?   Pasal lovin in awm reng dâwn em ni  ?   Ni lul lo ve ,  ka fanute u ,  nangmahni avâng hian ka rilru a na êm êm a ni ,  Lalpa kut ka tuar ta si a , ” a ti a .  
They lifted up their voice ,  and wept again :  and Orpah kissed her mother - in - law ,  but Ruth joined with her . 	Chu veleh râwl chhuah meuhvin an ṭap leh ta a ,  Orpi chuan a pi chu a fâwp a ,  a kîrsan ta a .  Ruthi erawh chuan a vuan tlat a .  
She said ,   " Behold ,  your sister - in - law has gone back to her people ,  and to her god .  Follow your sister - in - law .  " 	Naomi chuan ,    “  En teh ,  i mopui pawh a chite leh a pathian hnênah a hâwn leh tâk saw ,  i mopui saw zui haw ve rawh , ” a ti a .  
Ruth said ,   " Don ' t entreat me to leave you ,  and to return from following after you ,  for where you go ,  I will go ;  and where you lodge ,  I will lodge ;  your people shall be my people ,  and your God my God ; 	Ruthi erawh chuan ,    “  Nangmah ṭhen tûr leh kîrsan tûr che chuan min thlêm lo hrâm rawh ;  i kalna apiangah ka kal ang a ,  i riahna apiangah ka riak ang ;  i chite chu ka chite an ni ang a ,  i Pathian chu ka Pathian a ni ang .  
where you die ,  will I die ,  and there will I be buried .  Yahweh do so to me ,  and more also ,  if anything but death part you and me .  " 	I thihnaah ka thi ang a ,  chutah chuan min phûm ve mai rawh se .  Nang leh kei hi thihna chauh lo chuan thil dangin min ṭhen dâwn ai chuan Lalpan eng ang pawhin ;  a duh duhin min ti rawh se , ” a ti a .  
When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her ,  she left off speaking to her . 	A hnêna kal ve a tum tlat tih a hriatin Naomi chuan a ngawihsan ta a .  
So they two went until they came to Bethlehem .  It happened ,  when they were come to Bethlehem ,  that all the city was moved about them ,  and  [ the women ]  said ,   " Is this Naomi  ?   " 	Tichuan ,  Bethlehem thlengin an kal dûn ta a .  Bethlehem an han thlen chuan a khuain an phu ta mur mur a ,  nuho chuan ,    “  Hei Naomi kha a ni maw  ?  ” an ti a .  
She said to them ,   " Don ' t call me Naomi .  Call me Mara ;  for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me . 	Naomi chuan an hnênah ,    “  Naomi min ti tawh suh u ,  Marai min ti zâwk rawh u .  Engkimtitheia chuan na takin min thunun ta si a .  
I went out full ,  and Yahweh has brought me home again empty ;  why do you call me Naomi ,  since Yahweh has testified against me ,  and the Almighty has afflicted me  ?   " 	Kokim takin kan kal chhuak a ,  Lalpa chuan kutbêngin min hruai hâwng leh ta a nih hi .  Engati nge ,  Naomi min la tih cheu le ,  Lalpa chuan min thunun a ,  Engkimtitheia chuan ka chungah chhiatna a thlentîr ta si a , ” a ti a .  
So Naomi returned ,  and Ruth the Moabitess ,  her daughter - in - law ,  with her ,  who returned out of the country of Moab :  and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest . 	Naomi chu a monu Moab mi nên Moab ram aṭangin an lo kîr a ,  barli seng ṭan tirh laiin Bethlehem khua chu an lo thleng a ni . 
He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray ,  and not give up , 	Tin ,  beidawng lova ṭawngṭai fan fan tûr a nihzia tehkhin thuin a hrilh a : 
saying ,   " There was a judge in a certain city who didn ' t fear God ,  and didn ' t respect man . 	  “  Khaw engah emaw rorêltu pakhat a awm a ;  Pathian a ṭih lo va ,  mihring lah a pawisa hek lo . 
A widow was in that city ,  and she often came to him ,  saying ,   ' Defend me from my adversary !  ' 	Chumi khuaah chuan hmeithai pakhat a awm a ,   ‘ Ka khingpui nêna kan thubuai min chinfelsak rawh , ’ tiin a hnênah a lo kal chhên a . 
He wouldn ' t for a while ,  but afterward he said to himself ,   ' Though I neither fear God ,  nor respect man , 	Ani chuan eng emaw chhûng chu a lo duh lo va ,  nakinah erawh chuan a rilruin ,  Pathian ṭih lovin mihring pawisa lo mah ila , 
yet because this widow bothers me ,  I will defend her ,  or else she will wear me out by her continual coming .  '  " 	he hmeithai hian mi tibuai êm a ,  ka tihfelsak mai teh ang ;  chuti lo chu a lo kal fo âwm si a ,  a ninawm lutuk dâwn , ’ a ti a , ” a ti a .  
The Lord said ,   " Listen to what the unrighteous judge says . 	Lalpa chuan a sawi zêl a ,    “  Rorêltu fel lo thu sawi chu hre rawh u , 
Won ' t God avenge his chosen ones ,  who are crying out to him day and night ,  and yet he exercises patience with them  ?  	A mi thlan ,  a chhûn a zâna amah autute thu chu Pathian chuan a chinfelsak thuai dâwn lâwm ni  ?   A muangchâng dâwn em ni  ?  
I tell you that he will avenge them quickly .  Nevertheless ,  when the Son of Man comes ,  will he find faith on the earth  ?   " 	Ka hrilh a che u ,  a rawn chinfelsak thuai ang .  Amaherawhchu ,  Mihring Fapa hian a lo kal hunah khawvêlah rinna a rawn hmu ang em ni  ?  ” a ti a .  
He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness ,  and who despised all others . 	Fel inti hlea ,  mi dangte hmusit ṭhînte hnênah he tehkhin thu hi a sawi a . 
 " Two men went up into the temple to pray ;  one was a Pharisee ,  and the other was a tax collector . 	  “  Mi pahnih tempulah ṭawngṭai tûrin an chho va ;  pakhat chu Farisai a ni a ,  pakhat chu chhiahkhawntu a ni . 
The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this :   ' God ,  I thank you ,  that I am not like the rest of men ,  extortioners ,  unrighteous ,  adulterers ,  or even like this tax collector . 	Farisai chu a ding a ,  hetiang hian a ṭawngṭai a ,   ‘ Aw Pathian ,  mi dang anga mi bum hmang ,  Dân bawhchhia ,  uire leh he chhiahkhawntu ang pawh hi ka nih loh avângin lâwmthu ka hrilh a che . 
I fast twice a week .  I give tithes of all that I get .  ' 	Chawlhkâr tin vawi hnih chaw ka nghei ziah a ,  ka neih apiangah sâwma pakhat ka pe ṭhîn , ’ tiin . 
But the tax collector ,  standing far away ,  wouldn ' t even lift up his eyes to heaven ,  but beat his breast ,  saying ,   ' God ,  be merciful to me ,  a sinner !  ' 	Chhiahkhawntu erawh chu hnung feah a ding a ,  vân lam pawh a en ngam lo va ,   ‘ Aw Pathian ,  kei mi sual hi mi khawngaih rawh , ’ tiin a âwm a inchûm a inchûm ta zâwk a .  
I tell you ,  this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ;  for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled ,  but he who humbles himself will be exalted .  " 	  “  Ka hrilh a che u ,  a hmasa aiin chu mi zâwk chu thiam changin a in lamah a haw thla ta a .  Inngaihlu apiang an tlâwm ang a ,  inngaitlâwm apiang chawimawi an ni ang , ” a ti a .  
They were also bringing their babies to him ,  that he might touch them .  But when the disciples saw it ,  they rebuked them . 	A deh atân nausênte lam pawh an rawn hruai a ,  zirtîrte erawh chuan an lo hnar a . 
Jesus summoned them ,  saying ,   " Allow the little children to come to me ,  and don ' t hinder them ,  for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these . 	Nimahsela ,  Isuan anni chu a ko va ,    “  Naupangte ka hnênah han kaltîr ula ,  hnar tawh suh u ;  Pathian ram chu hetiang mite ta a ni si a . 
Most certainly ,  I tell you ,  whoever doesn ' t receive the Kingdom of God like a little child ,  he will in no way enter into it .  " 	Thu dik ka hrilh a che u ,  Pathian ram chu naupang anga lâwm lo apiang tu mah a chhûngah an lût tawp lo vang , ” a ti a .  
A certain ruler asked him ,  saying ,   " Good Teacher ,  what shall I do to inherit eternal life  ?   " 	Tin ,  hotu pakhatin a hnênah ,    “  Zirtîrtu Ṭha ,  chatuan nun ka chan theih nân eng nge ka tih ang  ?  ” tiin a zâwt a . 
Jesus asked him ,   " Why do you call me good  ?   No one is good ,  except one -  - God . 	Isuan ,    “  Engati nge Ṭha mi tih  ?   Tu mah ṭha an awm lo ,  Pathian chauh lo chu . 
You know the commandments :   ' Don ' t commit adultery ,  '   ' Don ' t murder ,  '   ' Don ' t steal ,  '   ' Don ' t give false testimony ,  '   ' Honor your father and your mother .  '  " 	Thupêkte chu i hria alâwm uire suh ,  tual that suh ,  ru suh ,  dâwtin hêk suh ,  i nu leh i pa chawimawi rawh ,  tihte hi , ” a ti a . 
He said ,   " I have observed all these things from my youth up .  " 	Ani chuan ,    “  Chûng zawng zawng chu ka tleirâwl chhuah tirh ata ka zâwm ṭhîn , ” a ti a .  
When Jesus heard these things ,  he said to him ,   " You still lack one thing .  Sell all that you have ,  and distribute it to the poor .  You will have treasure in heaven .  Come ,  follow me .  " 	Chu chu a hriatin Isuan a hnênah ,    “  Kawng khat i la bâk e ;  i neih zawng zawng hralh la ,  pachhiate sem rawh ;  chutichuan ,  vânah ro i nei dâwn nia ;  tin ,  lo kal la ,  mi zui ang che , ” a ti a . 
But when he heard these things ,  he became very sad ,  for he was very rich . 	Chûng thu a han hriat chuan a lungngai ta hle a ,  mi hausa tak a ni si a .  
Jesus ,  seeing that he became very sad ,  said ,   " How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God ! 	Isuan ani chu a hmuhin ,    “  Sum ngahte tân Pathian rama luh a va harsa êm ! 
For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle ' s eye ,  than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God .  " 	Pathian rama mi hausa an luh aiin ,  hriau benga sanghâwngsei luh tlang a âwl zâwk si a , ” a ti a . 
Those who heard it said ,   " Then who can be saved  ?   " 	A lo ngaithlatute chuan ,    “  Chuti chu tu nge chhandam ni thei ang le  ?  ” an ti a . 
But he said ,   " The things which are impossible with men are possible with God .  " 	Ani erawh chuan ,    “  Mihring tih theih loh hi Pathian chuan a ti thei asin , ” a ti a .  
Peter said ,   " Look ,  we have left everything ,  and followed you .  " 	Petera chuan ,    “  Ngai teh ,  kan in leh lo kalsanin kan zui ta che a , ” a han ti a .  
He said to them ,   " Most certainly I tell you ,  there is no one who has left house ,  or wife ,  or brothers ,  or parents ,  or children ,  for the Kingdom of God ' s sake , 	Isuan ,    “  Thu dik ka hrilh a che u ,  Pathian ram avânga in emaw ,  nupui emaw ,  unaute emaw ,  nu leh pa emaw ,  fate emaw kalsan tawh phawt chuan tûnah ngei pawh hian , 
who will not receive many times more in this time ,  and in the world to come ,  eternal life .  " 	a aia tam daih an hmu ngei ang ,  hun lo la thleng tûra chatuan nunna nên , ” a ti a .  
He took the twelve aside ,  and said to them ,   " Behold ,  we are going up to Jerusalem ,  and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed . 	Sâwmpahnihte chu a hruai hrang a ,  an hnênah ,    “  Ngai teh u ,  Jerusalem - ah kan chhoh dâwn hi ;  Mihring Fapa chungchâng thu zâwlneite hmanga ziak zawng zawng kha a thleng kim dâwn . 
For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles ,  will be mocked ,  treated shamefully ,  and spit on . 	Jentail - te hnênah an hlân ang a ;  anni chuan an lo nuihzat ang a ,  zahthlâk takin an sawisa ang ;  chil an chhâk ang a ; 
They will scourge and kill him .  On the third day ,  he will rise again .  " 	an vua ang a ,  an tihlum ang ;  ni thum ni - ah a tho leh ang , ” a ti a .  
They understood none of these things .  This saying was hidden from them ,  and they didn ' t understand the things that were said . 	Chûng thu chu a ngaihna an hre lo ,  an laka thup a ni a ,  a thu sawi chu an man lo va ni .  
It happened ,  as he came near Jericho ,  a certain blind man sat by the road ,  begging . 	Jeriko khua a lo thlen dâwn chuan mitdel pakhat hi kawng sîrah kut dawhin a lo ṭhu a . 
Hearing a multitude going by ,  he asked what this meant . 	Mipui kal thâwm a hriat chuan eng nge ni ta tih a zâwt a . 
They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by . 	  “  Nazaret Isua a lo kal a ni , ” an ti a . 
He cried out ,   " Jesus ,  you son of David ,  have mercy on me !  " 	Tichuan ,    “  Isu ,  Davida Fapa ,  mi khawngaih rawh , ” tiin a au ta a . 
Those who led the way rebuked him ,  that he should be quiet ;  but he cried out all the more ,   " You son of David ,  have mercy on me !  " 	Kal hmasate chuan an hau va ,  ngawi tûra an tih pawhin a hma aia ringin ,    “  Davida Fapa ,  mi khawngaih rawh , ” tiin a au zual sauh va .  
Standing still ,  Jesus commanded him to be brought to him .  When he had come near ,  he asked him , 	Isua chu a ding a ,  a hnêna han hruai tûrin a hrilh a . 
 " What do you want me to do  ?   "  He said ,   " Lord ,  that I may see again .  " 	A kiang hnai a lo thlen chuan ,    “  Eng nge tihsak che ila i duh  ?  ” a ti a .  Ani chuan ,    “  Lalpa ,  hmuh theih ka duh , ” a ti a . 
Jesus said to him ,   " Receive your sight .  Your faith has healed you .  " 	Tichuan Isuan ,    “  Hmu thei tawh ang che ,  i rinna hi i dam phah a ni e , ” a ti a . 
Immediately he received his sight ,  and followed him ,  glorifying God .  All the people ,  when they saw it ,  praised God . 	Thâwklehkhatan khua a hmu thei ta a .  Pathian fak chung zêlin amah chu a zui ve ta a .  Mi zawng zawngin chu chu an hmuhin Pathian an fak a .  
The burden of Damascus :   " Behold ,  Damascus is taken away from being a city ,  and it will be a ruinous heap . 	Damaska chungthu :    “  Damaska chu khua pawh a ni tawh lo vang ,  Thil chhe awm khâwm mai a ni ang . 
The cities of Aroer are forsaken .  They will be for flocks ,  which shall lie down ,  and none shall make them afraid . 	Aroer khuate chu an rauhsan vek ang a ,  Ran rual tlatna hmun a ni ang .  Thlamuang takin an bawk ang a ,  Tu man an hnawt lo vang . 
The fortress shall cease from Ephraim ,  and the kingdom from Damascus ,  and the remnant of Syria .  They will be as the glory of the children of Israel ,  "  says Yahweh of Armies . 	Efraim ramah kulh rêng a awm lo vang a ,  Damaska ram pawh a ṭiau vek ang ,  Suria rama la dam chhunte chu Israel - te ropuina chuai ta ang an ni ang , ” Engkim Lalpa thuchhuak chuan a ti . 
 " It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin ,  and the fatness of his flesh will become lean . 	  “  Chumi ni chuan Jakoba ropuina a ral ang a ,  A hausa a ,  mahse ,  a pachhe hle tawh dâwn a ni . 
It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat ,  and his arm reaps the grain .  Yes ,  it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim . 	Buh sengtuin Refaim phai buh an seng zawha ,  Lâk hmaih la awm pheuh pheuh ang hi an la ni ang . 
Yet gleanings will be left there ,  like the shaking of an olive tree ,  two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough ,  four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree ,  "  says Yahweh ,  the God of Israel . 	Oliv rah sâwi ṭilh tawh ,  A lêr sânga pahnih khat rah veu veu ,  A zâr sei deuh hmâwra pali panga la awm ang hi an la ni ang , ” Israel - te Pathian ,  Lalpa thuchhuak chuan a ti . 
In that day ,  people will look to their Maker ,  and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel . 	Chutih hunah chuan miten anmahni siamtu lam an hawi ang a ,  Israel Mi Thianghlima chu an thlîr ang . 
They will not look to the altars ,  the work of their hands ;  neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made ,  either the Asherim ,  or the incense altars . 	Kuta an siam maichâmte chu an ngaihsak lo vang a ,  anmahni siam Aseri - te leh rimtui hâlna maichâmte chu an melh duh tawh lo vang . 
In that day ,  their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top ,  which were forsaken from before the children of Israel ;  and it will be a desolation . 	Israel - te hmaa Hiv mite leh Amor mite khawpui rauhsan ang mai khân an khawpui kulh ṭha tak takte chu an tlânsan ang a ,  a ram hun a lo thleng ang . 
For you have forgotten the God of your salvation ,  and have not remembered the rock of your strength .  Therefore you plant pleasant plants ,  and set out foreign seedlings . 	In chhandamtu Pathian chu in theihnghilh a ,  In himna lungpui chu in hre duh ta si lo .  Mawi tak takin huan serh in siam zâwk a ,  Hnam dang pathian biak chu in thlang ta a . 
In the day of your planting ,  you hedge it in .  In the morning ,  you make your seed blossom ,  but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow . 	In phun tûk lawkah chuan In thil phunte nungin pâr mah sela ,  A rah lawh tûr a awm hauh lo vang ,  Buai leh na reh thei lo a lo thlen ni - ah chuan .  Hmêlmate tihchhiat an ni dâwn
Ah ,  the uproar of many peoples ,  who roar like the roaring of the seas ;  and the rushing of nations ,  that rush like the rushing of mighty waters ! 	Chei ! Tuifinriat fâwn angin Hnam liante chu an lo ri hum hum a ,  Tuifâwn buan buan angin An che buan buan a ni . 
The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters :  but he will rebuke them ,  and they will flee far off ,  and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind ,  and like the whirling dust before the storm . 	Chûng mite chu lo fâwn buan buan mah se ,  Lalpan a hau vang a ,  an reh duak ang ,  Tlângah thliin buhsi a chhêm lên leh ,  Thlipui chhêm lên vaivut ang hian an bo duak ang . 
At evening ,  behold ,  terror !  Before the morning ,  they are no more .  This is the portion of those who plunder us ,  and the lot of those who rob us . 	Tlai lamah chuan an hlauhawm êm êm a ,  Zîng lamah chuan hlauh tûr an awm ta lo ,  Chu chu min rawk tumtu ,  min ram tumte chanvo tûr chu a ni . 
You shall not see your brother ' s ox or his sheep go astray ,  and hide yourself from them :  you shall surely bring them again to your brother . 	  “  I chipui ,  Israel mi bâwng emaw ,  berâm emaw thlun chhuak i hmuh chuan hai der suh ,  khalh hâwnsak rawh .  
If your brother isn ' t near to you ,  or if you don ' t know him ,  then you shall bring it home to your house ,  and it shall be with you until your brother seek after it ,  and you shall restore it to him . 	A neitu chu khaw dang hla taka awm a nihin emaw ,  a neitu i hriat bawk si loh emaw chuan i inah kai haw ang che .  
So you shall do with his donkey ;  and so you shall do with his garment ;  and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother ' s ,  which he has lost ,  and you have found :  you may not hide yourself . 	A sabengtung bo i hmuhin emaw ,  a puan hloh i chharin emaw ,  thil eng pawh ,  i unau Israel thil hloh i hmuh chuan ,  chutiang chuan ti ang che .  
You shall not see your brother ' s donkey or his ox fallen down by the way ,  and hide yourself from them :  you shall surely help him to lift them up again . 	  “  In unau Israel bâwngpa emaw ,  sabengtung emaw kawnga tlu i hmuh chuan haider suh ,  kaihthawhpui ang che .  
A woman shall not wear men ' s clothing ,  neither shall a man put on women ' s clothing ;  for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God . 	  “  Hmeichhiain mipa thawmhnaw a inbel tûr a ni lo ;  mipain hmeichhe thawmhnaw a inbel tûr a ni hek lo ;  Lalpa in Pathianin chutiang chu a ten a ni .  
If a bird ' s nest chance to be before you in the way ,  in any tree or on the ground ,  with young ones or eggs ,  and the hen sitting on the young ,  or on the eggs ,  you shall not take the hen with the young : 	  “  Thingah emaw ,  leiah emaw sava bu awp lai ,  a tui keu tawh emaw ,  keu lo emaw i hmuh chuan a pui man suh ,  
you shall surely let the hen go ,  but the young you may take to yourself ;  that it may be well with you ,  and that you may prolong your days . 	a notê chu i la thei ang ,  a pui erawh chu i chhuah tûr a ni ;  tichuan ,  i tân a ṭha ang a ,  i dam rei bawk ang .  
When you build a new house ,  then you shall make a battlement for your roof ,  that you don ' t bring blood on your house ,  if any man fall from there . 	  “  In i sak chuan chungzâwl khuaptu i siam tûr a ni ;  tichuan ,  tu emaw pawh tla palhin thi sela ,  a mawh i phur lo vang .  
You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed ,  lest the whole fruit be forfeited ,  the seed which you have sown ,  and the increase of the vineyard . 	  “  Grep huanah thei dang phun suh ,  i phun kawp chuan i grep rah pawh ,  i thil phun rah pawh Pathian tâna serh hran a ni ang .  
You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together . 	Bâwngpa leh sabengtung lei rih duntîr suh .  
You shall not wear a mixed stuff ,  wool and linen together . 	La leh sahmul kaih pawlh kawr ha suh .  
You shall make yourselves fringes on the four borders of your cloak ,  with which you cover yourself . 	I puan sin kil li - ah pehbuk siam ṭhîn ang che .   
If any man takes a wife ,  and goes in to her ,  and hates her , 	  “  Miin nupui a nei a ,  nakin deuhvah chuan a ning ta a .  
and accuses her of shameful things ,  and brings up an evil name on her ,  and says ,   " I took this woman ,  and when I came near to her ,  I didn ' t find in her the tokens of virginity ;  " 	Dâwt phuahchawpin thil ṭha lo pui pui a puh a ,   ‘ nula thianghlim a nihna pawh ka hmu lo’ tiin a timualpho va . 
then shall the father of the young lady ,  and her mother ,  take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady ' s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate ; 	Chutiang thilah chuan hmeichhe nu leh pate chuan an induh zâna an âwngphah thisen kai chu nula thianghlim ngei a ni tih fiah nân khaw upate hnênah an thlen tûr a ni . 
and the young lady ' s father shall tell the elders ,   " I gave my daughter to this man to wife ,  and he hates her ; 	Hmeichhe pa chuan upate hnênah ,   ‘ He mi hi ka fanu ka neihtîr a ,  a duh leh ta si lo va . 
and behold ,  he has accused her of shameful things ,  saying ,   ' I didn ' t find in your daughter the tokens of virginity ;  '  and yet these are the tokens of my daughter ' s virginity .  "  They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city . 	Dâwtin thil ṭha lo pui pui a puh a ,   ‘ ka neih khân nula thianghlim a lo ni lo’ te a ti a .  Kan fanu hi nula thianghlim ngei a ni tih fiah nân hei ,  an induh zâna an âwngphah thisen kai hi en teh u , ’ a ti ang a ;  upaho hmaah chuan a phawrh ang .  
The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him ; 	Khaw upate chuan chu pa chu an vua ang .  
and they shall fine him one hundred  [ shekels ]  of silver ,  and give them to the father of the young lady ,  because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel :  and she shall be his wife ;  he may not put her away all his days . 	Israel nula thianghlim hming a tihchhiat avângin tangkaraw tlang za an chawitîr ang a ,  hmeichhe pa hnênah chuan an pe ang ,  a nupui a ni reng ang a ,  a dam chhûng chuan a ma thei lo vang .  
But if this thing be true ,  that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady ; 	Chu pa chuan thu dik a sawi a ,  nula thianghlim a nihna fiahna a awm loh chuan ,  
then they shall bring out the young lady to the door of her father ' s house ,  and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones ,  because she has done folly in Israel ,  to play the prostitute in her father ' s house :  so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you . 	a pa kawtah an hruai ang a ,  khuaa mite chuan lungin an dêng hlum tûr a ni .  Israel mite zîngah thil tenawm tak a ti a ni ,  a pa ina a la awm lai ,  pasal a la neih hmain tlangvâl a lo nei a ni .  Chutiang chuan Israel zîngah thil ṭha lo in thian fai tûr a ni .  
If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband ,  then they shall both of them die ,  the man who lay with the woman ,  and the woman :  so you shall put away the evil from Israel . 	Mi dang nupui mutpuitu chu a hmeichhia nên an pahnihin tihhlum tûr an ni .  Chutiang chuan Israel zîngah thil ṭha lo in thian fai tûr a ni .  
If there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband ,  and a man find her in the city ,  and lie with her ; 	  “  Nula thianghlim ,  pasal hual nei chu ,  khaw chhûngah miin a lo mutpui chuan ,  
then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city ,  and you shall stone them to death with stones ;  the lady ,  because she didn ' t cry ,  being in the city ;  and the man ,  because he has humbled his neighbor ' s wife :  so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you . 	an pahnih chuan khaw kulh kawngka bulah in hruai ang a ,  lungin in dêng hlum tûr a ni ;  hmeichhia chu khaw chhûnga awm siin a au lo va ,  mipa pawh chu mi nupui hual a lo mutpui avângin den hlum tûr a ni . 
But if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field ,  and the man force her ,  and lie with her ;  then the man only who lay with her shall die : 	  “  Nula thianghlim pasal hual nei ,  ram hnuaiah miin lo sual sela ,  a mipa chauh chu den hlum tûr a ni .  
but to the lady you shall do nothing ;  there is in the lady no sin worthy of death :  for as when a man rises against his neighbor ,  and kills him ,  even so is this matter ; 	Hmeichhe chungah chuan kutthlâk tûr a ni lo ,  thihna khawp eng mah thil sual a ti lo ;  mi pakhatin mi dang a bei a ,  a that ta mai ang hi a ni .  
for he found her in the field ,  the pledged to be married lady cried ,  and there was none to save her . 	A mipa khân mi nupui hual ramhnuaiah a sual lui a ,  a hmeichhia chu au mah se tu mah chhan tûr an awm lo va ni .  
If a man find a lady who is a virgin ,  who is not pledged to be married ,  and lay hold on her ,  and lie with her ,  and they be found ; 	  “  Miin nula thianghlim ,  pasal hual la nei lo ,  sual sela ,  
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady ' s father fifty  [ shekels ]  of silver ,  and she shall be his wife ,  because he has humbled her ;  he may not put her away all his days . 	mipa chuan hmeichhe pa hnênah nupui man pangngai tangkaraw tlang sawmnga a pe tûr a ni ;  a sual lui a ,  a nupui a ni nghâl ang .  A dam chhûngin a ma thei lo vang .  
A man shall not take his father ' s wife ,  and shall not uncover his father ' s skirt . 	  “  Tu man ,  mahni pa nupuite zînga mi mutpuiin a pa chu a timualpho tûr a ni lo .  
After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision ,  saying ,   " Don ' t be afraid ,  Abram .  I am your shield ,  your exceedingly great reward .  " 	Chûng thil hnuah chuan Abrama chu zêlin a awm a ,  Lalpa chuan a rawn bia a .    “  Abram ,  thlaphâng suh ,  I tân phaw ka nih hi ,  I dawn tûr hi a ropui a ni , ” a rawn ti a . 
Abram said ,   " Lord Yahweh ,  what will you give me ,  since I go childless ,  and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus  ?   " 	Abrama chuan ,    “  Aw Lalpa Pathian ,  fa ka nei lo hlen mai dâwn a ,  ka rokhâwmtu tûr lah Damaska mi Eliezara daih a ni ang a ,  eng nge mi dawntîr ang  ?  ” a ti a . 
Abram said ,   " Behold ,  to me you have given no seed :  and ,  behold ,  one born in my house is my heir .  " 	Abrama chuan a sawi zêl a ,    “  Ngai teh ,  fa min pe si lo va ,  ka ina piang ka chhiahhlawhin ka ro a luah ngei dâwn mai , ” a ti a . 
Behold ,  the word of Yahweh came to him ,  saying ,   " This man will not be your heir ,  but he who will come forth out of your own body will be your heir .  " 	Lalpa chuan a rawn chhâng a ,    “  Chu mi chu i roluahtu tûr a ni lo ,  nangma fa ngeiin i ro a luah ang , ” a ti a . 
Yahweh brought him outside ,  and said ,   " Look now toward the sky ,  and count the stars ,  if you are able to count them .  "  He said to Abram ,   " So shall your seed be .  " 	Pâwnah a hruai chhuak a ,    “  Vân lam khi thlîr teh ,  arsite khi i chhiar sêng em  ?  ” a ti a .    “  Khiti zât khi i thlahte an la ni dâwn” a ti a . 
He believed in Yahweh ;  and he reckoned it to him for righteousness . 	Lalpa chu a ring a ,  chu chu a diknaah a lo pawmsak ta a . 
He said to him ,   " I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees ,  to give you this land to inherit it .  " 	A hnênah chuan heti hian a ti ta a :    “  He ram hi neihtîr tûr chein Kaldai ram Ur khua aṭanga ko chhuaktu che Lalpa kha ka ni , ” a ti a . 
He said ,   " Lord Yahweh ,  how will I know that I will inherit it  ?   " 	Ani chuan ,    “  Aw Lalpa Pathian ,  ka ta tûr a nih engtin nge ka hriat ang  ?  ” tiin a chhâng a . 
He said to him ,   " Bring me a heifer three years old ,  a female goat three years old ,  a ram three years old ,  a turtledove ,  and a young pigeon .  " 	  “  Bâwngpa kum thum mi te ,  kêlpui kum thum mi te ,  berâmpa kum thum mi te ,  ṭhuro leh pârva no nên mi han lâk teh , ” a ti a . 
He brought him all of these ,  and divided them in the middle ,  and laid each half opposite the other ;  but he didn ' t divide the birds . 	Chûng chu a rawn lâksak a ,  a laiah a phel a ,  a phel chu inepin a tlarin a dah a ;  savate erawh chu a phel lo . 
The birds of prey came down on the carcasses ,  and Abram drove them away . 	Sa ruangahte chuan mu an lo ṭum ṭhîn a ,  Abrama chuan a lo hnawt zêl a . 
When the sun was going down ,  a deep sleep fell on Abram .  Now terror and great darkness fell on him . 	Ni a tlâk dâwn suar suar chuan a muhîl ta sulh a ,  hlauhawm thim takin a rawn bawh ta a . 
He said to Abram ,   " Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs ,  and will serve them .  They will afflict them four hundred years . 	Abrama hnênah chuan ,    “  I thlahte chu an hriat ngai loh ramah mikhual an ni dâwn ;  bawihah an tâng ang a ,  kum zali chhûng chu an tiduhdah ang tih hre rawh . 
I will also judge that nation ,  whom they will serve .  Afterward they will come out with great wealth , 	Rawng an bâwlsak hnamte chu ka hrem ang a ,  chumi hnuah chu ram chu muk ṭânin an chhuahsan ang . 
but you will go to your fathers in peace .  You will be buried in a good old age . 	Nang erawh chu ,  thlamuang takin i pi leh pute hnênah i châwl ve ang a ,  tarkûna damin an phûm ang che . 
In the fourth generation they will come here again ,  for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full .  " 	Mi dang erawh chu chhuan li a ral hunah hetah hian an lo kîr leh ang ,  Amor mite suahsualna vâwrtâwp a thlen hunah chuan , ” a ti a . 
It came to pass that ,  when the sun went down ,  and it was dark ,  behold ,  a smoking furnace ,  and a flaming torch passed between these pieces . 	Ni a tlâka ,  khua a thim tâk hle hnuin thuk ,  khu lût lût leh meichher alh hluah hluah chu sa ruang kârah chuan a vei a vei a . 
In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram ,  saying ,   " To your seed I have given this land ,  from the river of Egypt to the great river ,  the river Euphrates : 	Chumi zân chuan Lalpan Abrama hnênah thu a thlung ta a ,    “  He ram hi i thlahte hnênah ka pe ta .  Aigupta ram lui aṭanga Eufretis luipui inkâr ram ,

the Hittites ,  the Perizzites ,  the Rephaim , 	Hit mi te ,  Periz mi te ,  Refaim te , 
the Amorites ,  the Canaanites ,  the Girgashites ,  and the Jebusites .  " 	Amor mi te ,  Kanan mi te ,  Girgas leh Jebus mi te ram hi , ” a ti a . 
May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble .  May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high , 	Mangan ni - ah Lalpan chhângin ,  Jakoba Pathian chuan hum che rawh se . 
send you help from the sanctuary ,  grant you support from Zion , 	Hmun Thianghlim aṭanga ṭanpui chein ,  Zion aṭang chuan pui che rawh se . 
remember all your offerings ,  and accept your burnt sacrifice .  Selah . 	I thil hlan apiangte lo pawmin ,  I hâlral inthawina lo lâwm rawh se . 
May He grant you your heart ' s desire ,  and fulfill all your counsel . 	I duh apiang pe che sela ,  I thil ruahmante chu tipuitling ṭhîn rawh se . 
We will triumph in your salvation .  In the name of our God ,  we will set up our banners .  May Yahweh grant all your requests . 	Hnehtu i nih hunah lâwmin kan au vang a ,  Kan Pathian hmingin hnehna puanzâr kan zâr ang .  Lalpan i dîl apiang tihlawhtling ngei rawh se . 
Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed .  He will answer him from his holy heaven ,  with the saving strength of his right hand . 	Lalpan a hriakthiha a chhanhim ṭhîn tih ka hre ta .  A hmun thianghlim vân aṭang chuan a rawn chhâng ta ,  A ding lam chuan ropui takin a hnehtîr ta . 
Some trust in chariots ,  and some in horses ,  but we trust the name of Yahweh our God . 	Ṭhenkhatin an tawlailîr an ring a ,  Mi dangin an sakawrte an ring bawk a ,  Keini zawngin Lalpa kan Pathian hming kan lam zâwk ang . 
They are bowed down and fallen ,  but we rise up ,  and stand upright . 	Chûng mite chu tluin an thal dêr ang a ,  Keini chu kan tho vang a ,  kan ding nghet leh ang . 
Save ,  Yahweh !  Let the King answer us when we call !  For the Chief Musician .  A Psalm by David . 	Lalpa ,  lal hi han chhandam teh ,  Kan koh che chuan min chhâng ang che . 
Sing to Yahweh a new song ,  for he has done marvelous things !  His right hand ,  and his holy arm ,  have worked salvation for him . 	A thil mak tih ropui tak avângin ,  Lalpa chu fakin hla thar sa rawh u ,  A kut ding lam leh a bân thianghlim ngei chuan Chhandamna a rawn thlen ta .  
Yahweh has made known his salvation .  He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations . 	Lalpan a hnehna chu a rawn lantîr a ,  Hnam tin hmaah thil a tihdikzia a tilang ta .  
He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel .  All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God . 	Israel chhûngte chunga a ngilneihzia leh a rinawmzia a hre reng a ,  Pathian chhandamna chu khawvêl pum hian an hmu ta e .  
Make a joyful noise to Yahweh ,  all the earth !  Burst out and sing for joy ,  yes ,  sing praises ! 	Khawvêla mi hian Lalpa chu fak ula ,  Hlima auvin hla sa rawh u .  
Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp ,  with the harp and the voice of melody . 	Ṭingṭangte nên Lalpa fakna hla sa ula ,  Perhkhuang ri mawi tum bawk rawh u .  
With trumpets and sound of the ram ' s horn ,  make a joyful noise before the King ,  Yahweh . 	Tawtawrâwt leh seki tumin Kan Lalber ,  Lalpa hi fak chiam rawh u .  
Let the sea roar with its fullness ;  the world ,  and those who dwell therein . 	Tuifinriat leh a chhûnga awmte chu au dur dur se ,  Lei leh a chhûnga chêngte pawh .  
Let the rivers clap their hands .  Let the mountains sing for joy together . 	Luipuite chuan a hmaah an kut bêng sela ,  Tlângte pawh hi hlimin au rual rawh se .  
Let them sing before Yahweh ,  for he comes to judge the earth .  He will judge the world with righteousness ,  and the peoples with equity . 	Khawvêl rorêl tûrin Lalpa a lo kal e ,  Mi tin dik tak leh fel takin a rêlsak ang . 
Don ' t rebuke an older man ,  but exhort him as a father ;  the younger men as brothers ; 	Upa zâwkte chu hau suh la ,  mahni pa anga enin a ngenin ngên zâwk ang che ;  naupang zâwkte chu nau angin en la , 
the elder women as mothers ;  the younger as sisters ,  in all purity . 	Pitarte chu nu angin en la ,  nulate chu thianghlim takin farnu angin en ang che . 
Honor widows who are widows indeed . 	Mahni chauhva awm hmeithaite chu zah la ; 
But if any widow has children or grandchildren ,  let them learn first to show piety towards their own family ,  and to repay their parents ,  for this is acceptable in the sight of God . 	tu leh fa nei hmeithaite chu ,  an tu leh fate chuan Pathianin chhûngkaw mawhphurhna a pêk chu hlen chhuah zir phawt sela ,  anmahni châwm liantu chu châwm ve thung rawh se ,  chu chu Pathian lâwm zâwng a ni . 
Now she who is a widow indeed ,  and desolate ,  has her hope set on God ,  and continues in petitions and prayers night and day . 	Châwmtu nei lo ,  mahni chauhva hmeithai chuan ,  Pathian chauh rinchhan tûr a nei a ,  ṭanpuina dîlin a chhûn a zân a ṭawngṭai ṭhîn . 
But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives . 	Hmeithai leplêrh tak erawh chu ,  a dam lai pawhin mitthi mai a ni . 
Also command these things ,  that they may be without reproach . 	Hêng kaihhruainate hi hrilh la ,  sawisêlbovin awm rawh se . 
But if anyone doesn ' t provide for his own ,  and especially his own household ,  he has denied the faith ,  and is worse than an unbeliever . 	Mahni chhûngte ,  in khata awmpui ngei châwm duh lo an awm chuan ,  rinna hi an phatsan ta tihna a ni ,  ringlo mi aiin an sual zâwk . 
Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old ,  having been the wife of one man , 	 ( 9 , 10 )  Kum sawmruk la tling lo chu hmeithai zîngah ziak tel suh ;  pasal pakhat chauh nei ,  thil ṭha tih kawnga fak kai ,  fate lo enkawl tlei tawh ,  mikhual chunga ṭha ,  mi thianghlimte ke sil ṭhîn ,  mi mangang ṭanpui peih ,  thil ṭha tih kawnga inpe mi an ni bawk tûr a ni . 
being approved by good works ,  if she has brought up children ,  if she has been hospitable to strangers ,  if she has washed the saints '  feet ,  if she has relieved the afflicted ,  and if she has diligently followed every good work . 	 ( 9 , 10 )  Kum sawmruk la tling lo chu hmeithai zîngah ziak tel suh ;  pasal pakhat chauh nei ,  thil ṭha tih kawnga fak kai ,  fate lo enkawl tlei tawh ,  mikhual chunga ṭha ,  mi thianghlimte ke sil ṭhîn ,  mi mangang ṭanpui peih ,  thil ṭha tih kawnga inpe mi an ni bawk tûr a ni . 
But refuse younger widows ,  for when they have grown wanton against Christ ,  they desire to marry ; 	Hmeithai la nula deuhte chu telh suh ,  an châkna avângin Krista hawisana pasal neih an duh leh si ṭhîn a , 
having condemnation ,  because they have rejected their first pledge . 	an thu lo tiam tawh an bawhchhiat avângin sawisêl an kai ṭhîn . 
Besides ,  they also learn to be idle ,  going about from house to house .  Not only idle ,  but also gossips and busybodies ,  saying things which they ought not . 	Chu lovah pawh ,  mi ina an lên kualna lamah dâwngdah an zir a ,  dâwngdah mai pawh ni lovin mi rêl an chîng a ,  thu veivir an hrât a ,  an sawi loh tûr tûr an sawi ṭhîn . 
I desire therefore that the younger widows marry ,  bear children ,  rule the household ,  and give no occasion to the adversary for insulting . 	Chuvângin ,  hmeithai la nula deuhte chuan pasal nei leh se ka ti a ni ,  fate neiin chhûngkua enkawl sela ,  hmêlmaten min sawichhiatna tûr rêng an nei dâwn lo nia . 
For already some have turned aside after Satan . 	Ṭhenkhat chu Setana zuiin an pêng sual tawh a ni . 
If any man or woman who believes has widows ,  let them relieve them ,  and don ' t let the assembly be burdened ;  that it might relieve those who are widows indeed . 	Ringtu hmeichhiain ,  an chhûngkaw zîngah hmeithai nei se a châwm tûr a ni ;  mahnia hmeithaite chauh kohhranin an enkawl theih nân kohhran chu phurrit siamsak suh se . 
Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor ,  especially those who labor in the word and in teaching . 	Kohhran upa ,  mi hruai thiam ,  thu hril leh zirtîr lama taima bîkte chu a leh hniha chawimawi tlâk an ni . 
For the Scripture says ,   " You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain .  "  And ,   " The laborer is worthy of his wages .  " 	Lehkha Thu - in ,    “  Bâwngpain buh a chîl laiin a hmui phuar suh ;  hna thawktu chu hlawh hmu tlâk a ni , ” a ti a . 
Don ' t receive an accusation against an elder ,  except at the word of two or three witnesses . 	Upa an hêkna chu thuhretu pahnih emaw ,  pathum emaw tal an awm loh chuan pawm suh . 
Those who sin ,  reprove in the sight of all ,  that the rest also may be in fear . 	Thil tisual ngeite chu vântlâng hmaah zilh rawh ,  mi dang pawhin an hlauh theih nân . 
I command you in the sight of God ,  and Christ Jesus ,  and the chosen angels ,  that you observe these things without prejudice ,  doing nothing by partiality . 	Pathian leh Krista Isua leh a vântirhkoh thlante hmaah thu ka pe a che :  ngaih dân nei sa lovin ,  hleih nei lovin hêng thu hi kengkawh ang che . 
Lay hands hastily on no one ,  neither be a participant in other men ' s sins .  Keep yourself pure . 	Rawngbâwltu tûr nemngheh hmanhmawh lutuk suh la ,  mahni invawng thianghlim rawh . 
Be no longer a drinker of water only ,  but use a little wine for your stomach ' s sake and your frequent infirmities . 	Tui chauh in tawh lo la ,  na i nei fo si a ,  i pum nawm nân uain tlêm in ṭhîn ang che . 
Some men ' s sins are evident ,  preceding them to judgment ,  and some also follow later . 	Mi ṭhenkhat sualna chu a langsâr a ,  thiam loh chantîr nghâl theih a ni ;  ṭhenkhat sualna erawh chu rei fe hnuah lo chuan a lang nghâl mai lo . 
In the same way also there are good works that are obvious ,  and those that are otherwise can ' t be hidden . 	Chutiang bawkin thiltih ṭha chu a langsâr a ,  langsâr lo mah se ,  thup reng theih a ni chuang lo . 
The elder ,  to the chosen lady and her children ,  whom I love in truth ;  and not I only ,  but also all those who know the truth ; 	Upa chuan Hmeichhe Ṭha Pathian thlan leh a fate ,  thutaka ka hmangaihte chibai ka bûk e .  Keimah chauh pawh ni lovin ,  thutak hretu dang pawhin an hmangaih a che u ;  
for the truth ' s sake ,  which remains in us ,  and it will be with us forever : 	thutak ,  keimahnia chêng chu ,  kumkhuain kan hnênah a awm dâwn avângin .  
Grace ,  mercy ,  and peace will be with us ,  from God the Father ,  and from the Lord Jesus Christ ,  the Son of the Father ,  in truth and love . 	Thutak leh hmangaihnaah chuan Pa Pathian leh Pa Fapa Isua Krista hnên ata khawngaihna te ,  zahngaihna te ,  remna te chu kan hnênah a awm ang .  
I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth ,  even as we have been commanded by the Father . 	Pain thu min pêk anga i fa tute emaw thutaka an awm ka hmuh avângin ka lâwm a ni .  
Now I beg you ,  dear lady ,  not as though I wrote to you a new commandment ,  but that which we had from the beginning ,  that we love one another . 	Hmeichhe ṭha ,  thupêk thar ni lovin ,  a tîr ata kan dawn kha hrilh tûr chein ka ziak a ni :   ‘ i inhmangaih tawn ang u , ’ tiin ka ngên a che .  
This is love ,  that we should walk according to his commandments .  This is the commandment ,  even as you heard from the beginning ,  that you should walk in it . 	A thupêk ang zêla kan awm hi hmangaihna chu a ni ;  hei hi a thupêk ,  a tîr ata in hriat kha a ni ,   ‘ hmangaihnaah in awm reng tûr a ni , ’ tih hi .  
For many deceivers have gone out into the world ,  those who don ' t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh .  This is the deceiver and the Antichrist . 	Bumtu tam tak ,  Isua Krista chu tisa puin a lo kal tih pawm lote khawvêlah an lo chhuak ta a .  Chutiang mite chu bumtu leh Krista dodâltute an ni .  
Watch yourselves ,  that we don ' t lose the things which we have accomplished ,  but that we receive a full reward . 	In thawh chhuah sate chân lova in thawh hlawh a kima in hmuh theih zâwk nân ,  mahni invêng ṭha rawh u . 
Whoever transgresses and doesn ' t remain in the teaching of Christ ,  doesn ' t have God .  He who remains in the teaching ,  the same has both the Father and the Son . 	Tu pawh Krista zirtîrna thu - a khawsa lova kal khûm chuan Pathian a nei lo .  A zirtîrna thu - a khawsa reng chuan Pa leh Fapa a nei kawp a ni .  
If anyone comes to you ,  and doesn ' t bring this teaching ,  don ' t receive him into your house ,  and don ' t welcome him , 	Chu zirtîrna chu keng lova in hnêna lo kal chu tu mahin inah thlentîr suh ula ,  ṭawngkam ṭha pawhin lo be suh u :  
for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works . 	Ṭawngkam ṭhaa betu chu a thil sual tihah chuan a tel ve a ni .  
Having many things to write to you ,  I don ' t want to do so with paper and ink ,  but I hope to come to you ,  and to speak face to face ,  that our joy may be made full . 	In hnênah thu tam tak sawi tûr nei mah ila ,  lehkha leh lehkhatuia ziak ka tum lo ;  kan lâwm a kim theih nân in hnêna lo kala ,  inhmatawna inbiak ka beisei zâwk a ni .  
The children of your chosen sister greet you .  Amen . 	I laizâwnnu ,  thlan ni ve bawki faten chibai an bûk a che . 
It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints , 	Mi thianghlimte rawngbâwlsak thu hi in hnêna ziak tam a ngai lo ve ,  
for I know your readiness ,  of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia ,  that Achaia has been prepared for a year past .  Your zeal has stirred up very many of them . 	ṭanpui in peihzia ka hre si a .    “  Nikum khân Akaia ram chu an inpuahchah tawh , ” tiin ,  nangmahni chhuang takin Makedonia rama mite ka hrilh ṭhîn a ,  in ṭhahnemngaihna chuan mi tam tak a tiharh ta a .  
But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect ,  that ,  just as I said ,  you may be prepared , 	He thilah hian ka fak sual loh nân che u leh ka sawi ang ngeia in lo inpeih theih nân unaute hi ka rawn tîr a ni .  
so that I won ' t by any means ,  if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared ,  we  ( to say nothing of you )  should be disappointed in this confident boasting . 	Makedonia rama mite kan rualin lo kal ve ta sela ,  in la inpeih lo tih an rawn hmuh chuan ,  kan rin tehlul che u vei nên ,  in tân chauh ni lovin ,  kan tân pawh a zahthlâk hle dâwn asin .  
I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you ,  and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before ,  that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity ,  and not of greediness . 	Thawhlâwm in tiam tawh sate kha lo ching fel diam tûrin unaute hi rawn tirh hmasak ṭûlin ka hria a ;  in lo inpeih chuan in thil pêkte chu lâk luihsak che u ang ni lovin ,  nangmahni thu ngeia pêk a ni tih a lang chiang dâwn a ni .  
Remember this :  he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly .  He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully . 	Hre rawh u ,  hetiang kawngah hian tuh tlêm chuan a seng tlêm ang a ,  tuh tam erawh chuan a seng tam ang .  
Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart ;  not grudgingly ,  or under compulsion ;  for God loves a cheerful giver . 	Mi tinin an rilrua an tum sa ang chu ui lovin ,  tih luih ang ni hek lovin pe ṭheuh rawh se ;  Pathian chuan lâwm taka petu a ni a hmangaih ni .  
And God is able to make all grace abound to you ,  that you ,  always having all sufficiency in everything ,  may abound to every good work . 	Pathian chuan in mamawh thil ṭha tinrêng a pe ṭeuh thei che u a ,  in mamawh aia tam pawh thil ṭha in tih theih nân a pêk belhchhah thei che u a ni :  
As it is written ,   " He has scattered abroad ,  he has given to the poor .  His righteousness remains forever .  " 	  “  A sem darh a ,  tlachhamte a pe a ,  a ngilneihna chu kumkhuain a pângngai reng a ni , ” tih ziak ang khân .  
Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food ,  supply and multiply your seed for sowing ,  and increase the fruits of your righteousness ; 	Tuh atâna chi petu leh ei atâna chaw petu chuan chi a pe ṭeuh vang che u ,  a ṭhantîr ang a ,  in thilphalna rah chu a tipung bawk ang .  
you being enriched in everything to all liberality ,  which works through us thanksgiving to God . 	Kawng tinrênga thilphal hle tûrin a tihausa ang che u ;  tin ,  keimahni hmanga in thil pêk vâng hian Pathian hnênah lâwmthu an la sawi ang . 
For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints ,  but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God ; 	In chhawmdâwl rawngbâwl hna hian mi thianghlimte mamawh a phuhrûksak chauh ni lovin ,  Pathian hnêna lâwmthu sawina pawh nasa takin a tipung bawk ang .  
seeing that through the proof given by this service ,  they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ ,  and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all ; 	He in rawngbâwl hna hian Krista Chanchin Ṭha in pawma in zawmzia te ,  an tân leh mi dang tân in thilphalzia te a tilang a ,  chu chuan Pathian a chawimawitîr ngei ang . 
while they themselves also ,  with supplication on your behalf ,  yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you . 	Anni pawhin Pathian khawngaihna in dawn nasat êm avâng hian duhsak takin in tân an ṭawngṭai ngei ang .  
Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift ! 	A thilpêk sawi hleih theih loh avâng hian Pathian hnênah lâwmthu awm rawh se . 
Give ear to my words ,  Yahweh .  Consider my meditation . 	Aw Lalpa ,  ka thu hi lo ngaithla la ,  Ka rûm thâwm hi lo hria ang che .  
Listen to the voice of my cry ,  my King and my God ;  for to you do I pray . 	Ka Lal leh ka Pathian ,  Ka mangang authâwm hi min ngaihthlâksak ang che .  I hnêna ṭawngṭai ka ni si a .  
Yahweh ,  in the morning you shall hear my voice .  In the morning I will lay my requests before you ,  and will watch expectantly . 	Aw Lalpa ,  zîng takah ka aw i lo hria ang a ,  Min lo ngaithla ṭhîn ang che .  Zîng aṭangin ka ṭawngṭai ṭhîn a ,  Nghâkhlel takin ka lo thlîr ṭhîn che .  
For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness .  Evil can ' t live with you . 	Sualnaa lâwm ṭhîn Pathian i ni lo va ,  I bulah chuan thil sual a leng hek lo .  
The arrogant shall not stand in your sight .  You hate all workers of iniquity . 	Inchhuangte chu i hmaah an ding thei lo vang a ,  Thil sual titute chu i huatzâwng an ni si .  
You will destroy those who speak lies .  Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man . 	Dâwt sawi chîngte tiboral la ,  Tualthat leh bum chîngte chu ,  Lalpa tenzâwng tak an ni .  
But as for me ,  in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house .  I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you . 	Kei zawng i ngilneih êm vângin I inah hian ka lo lût a ,  Aw Lalpa ,  i tempul thianghlimah ,  Nangmah ṭih chungin ka lo kûn e .  
Lead me ,  Yahweh ,  in your righteousness because of my enemies .  Make your way straight before my face . 	Aw Lalpa ,  min beitute avângin ,  I felnaah min hruai la ,  I kawngte chu ka tân titluang ang che .  
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth .  Their heart is destruction .  Their throat is an open tomb .  They flatter with their tongue . 	Thutak rêng an sawi ngai lo va ,  An thinlung chu mi tihchhiat duhnain a khat a ;  An hrawk chu thlân inhawng a ni a ,  An kâin mi an fak der ṭhîn .  
Hold them guilty ,  God .  Let them fall by their own counsels ;  Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions ,  for they have rebelled against you . 	Aw Pathian ,  anniho hi hrem la ,  An remruat chu chhiat phah rawh se ;  An bawhchhiatna tam tak avângin paih daih ang che ,  I lakah hian an hel ta si a .  
But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice ,  Let them always shout for joy ,  because you defend them .  Let them also who love your name be joyful in you . 	Nangmah bêltute erawh chu an hlim ang a ,  Lâwmin an au kumkhua dâwn si ;  Anmahni chu i hum ang a ,  I hming ngainatute chuan an chhuang ang che .  
For you will bless the righteous .  Yahweh ,  you will surround him with favor as with a shield .  For the Chief Musician ;  on stringed instruments ,  upon the eight - stringed lyre .  A Psalm by David . 	Aw Lalpa ,  mi dikte chu mal i sâwm ṭhîn a ,  Phaw ang maiin duhsakna chuan i hual vêl ṭhîn . 
Wine is a mocker ,  and beer is a brawler .  Whoever is led astray by them is not wise . 	Zuin mi a tiuang a ,  Rakzuin buaina a tichhuak .  Zu rui mi fing an awm ngai lo .  
The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion .  He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life . 	Lal thinur chu sakeibaknei rûm ang a ni a ,  Tithinurtu chuan a nun a chân ang .  
It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife ;  but every fool will be quarreling . 	Intihbuainaa tel loh hi pa zahawm nihna a ni a ,  Mi â - te chu an inrawlh zen ṭhîn .  
The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter ;  therefore he shall beg in harvest ,  and have nothing . 	Mi thatchhia chuan a hunah lei a rît peih lo va ,  Buh seng tûr zawng mah se a nei lo vang .  
Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water ;  but a man of understanding will draw it out . 	Mihring ngaihtuahna hi li thûk tak ang a ni a ,  Mahse ,  mi fing chuan a dâwp chhuak thei .  
Many men claim to be men of unfailing love ,  but who can find a faithful man  ?  	Rinawm tak nia insawi an tam hle a ,  Rinawm tu nge hre chhuak thei ang  ?   
A righteous man walks in integrity .  Blessed are his children after him . 	Dik tak leh ngîl taka nung ṭhîn Fate chu an nihlawh e .  
A king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes . 	Rorêl tûra lal a ṭhutin Thil dik lo chu a hmu nghâl ṭhîn .  
Who can say ,   " I have made my heart pure .  I am clean and without sin  ?   " 	 ‘ Ka thinlung a thianghlim a ,  sual lakah ka fihlîm , ’ Tu nge ti thei  ?   
Differing weights and differing measures ,  both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh . 	Bûklung rit hlei te ,  Tehna no lian hlei te Lalpa tenzâwng a ni .  
Even a child makes himself known by his doings ,  whether his work is pure ,  and whether it is right . 	Naupang pawh a thiltihah a zia a lang ,  Mi ṭha a ni emaw ,  mi dik a ni emaw a hriat theih ṭhîn .  
The hearing ear ,  and the seeing eye ,  Yahweh has made even both of them . 	Beng thil hre thei ,  mit thil hmu theite hi Lalpa siam an ni e .  
Don ' t love sleep ,  lest you come to poverty .  Open your eyes ,  and you shall be satisfied with bread . 	Mut heh hle suh ,  i rethei dah ang e ,  I mit meng la ,  ei tûr i nei ṭeuh vang .  
 " It ' s no good ,  it ' s no good ,  "  says the buyer ;  but when he is gone his way ,  then he boasts . 	 ‘ A to mang e , ’ thil leitu chuan a ti ṭhîn a ,  Mual an liam a ,  an lei tlâwmzia an uanpui ṭhîn .  
There is gold and abundance of rubies ;  but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel . 	Rangkachak leh lunghlu chu a tam hle a ,  Thu fing tak chu lungmawi vâng tak ang a ni .  
Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger ;  and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman . 	Hmêlhriat loh leiba rulhsak tiamtu kawr chu Dahkham atân lâksak mai rawh .  
Fraudulent food is sweet to a man ,  but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel . 	Thil ei rûk chu a tui hle a ,  Mahse ,  kâa ṭiaulung khat ṭûn ang hi a la ni ang .  
Plans are established by advice ;  by wise guidance you wage war ! 	Thil ruahman laiin ngun taka ngaihtuah tûr a ni ,  Remruat diam hnuah chuan indo ṭan tûr a ni .  
He who goes about as a tale - bearer reveals secrets ;  therefore don ' t keep company with him who opens wide his lips . 	Mi ṭawng duh ,  lên heh chuan thurûk a puang ṭhîn a ,  Mi kamtam chu kâwm suh .  
Whoever curses his father or his mother ,  his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness . 	Nu leh pa ânchhe lawhtu chu Thima khâwnvâr mit ang hi a la ni ang .  
An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning ,  won ' t be blessed in the end . 	Awlsam taka sum leh pai neih mai theihte hi A tâwpah chuan a hlâwk lem lo .  
Don ' t say , " I will pay back evil .  "  Wait for Yahweh ,  and he will save you . 	 ‘ Thil sual ka thungrûl ang , ’ ti mai teh suh ,  Lalpa chu ngaichâng la ,  a rawn chhan ang che .  
Yahweh detests differing weights ,  and dishonest scales are not pleasing . 	Bûklung inang lo hi Lalpan a ten a ,  Bûkna dik lo a ṭha hek lo .  
A man ' s steps are from Yahweh ;  how then can man understand his way  ?  	Kan ke pênte hi Lalpa ruat a ni ,  Tu nge kan kalna tûr hre thei ang  ?   
It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication ,  then later to consider his vows . 	Ngaihtuah chiang lovin thilhlan Pathian hnêna pêk tiam suh ,  I tiam hnuah i la inchhîr leh dah ang e .  
A wise king winnows out the wicked ,  and drives the threshing wheel over them . 	Lal fing chuan mi sual a hmu thuai a ,  Tawlailîr a la chîltîr ang .  
The spirit of man is Yahweh ' s lamp ,  searching all his innermost parts . 	Lalpan mihring chhûngah khâwnvâr a dah a ,  Thinlung chhûngril a chhun chhuak vek a ni .  
Love and faithfulness keep the king safe .  His throne is sustained by love . 	Ngilneihna leh zahawmna hi lal humhimtu a ni a ,  Dikna avângin a lalṭhutthlêng a nghet a ni .  
The glory of young men is their strength .  The splendor of old men is their gray hair . 	Tlangvâl ropuina chu an chakna hi a ni a ,  Upa mawina pawh an lu vâr hi a ni .  
Wounding blows cleanse away evil ,  and beatings purge the innermost parts . 	Na taka vuakna hian sual simna a thlen a ,  Vuak nek hian chhûng lam a tithianghlim thei . 
Moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time ,  while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard ,  saying , 	Jeremia chu vêngtu hung chhûnga a la tân laiin a hnênah Lalpa thu a lo thleng leh a : 
Thus says Yahweh who does it ,  Yahweh who forms it to establish it ;  Yahweh is his name : 	  “  Leilung siamtu Lalpa ,  dintu leh tinghettu Lalpa ,  a hming Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :  
Call to me ,  and I will answer you ,  and will show you great things ,  and difficult ,  which you don ' t know . 	 ‘ Min ko la ,  ka chhâng ang che ,  i hriat ngai loh thil ropui leh ril tak ka hrilh ang che . ’ ” 
For thus says Yahweh ,  the God of Israel ,  concerning the houses of this city ,  and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah ,  which are broken down  [ to make a defense ]  against the mounds and against the sword ; 	Lalpa ,  Israel - te Pathian chuan he khaw chhûnga ṭanhmun siam nân in te ,  Juda lal inte an ṭhiat tâk chungchâng heti hian a sawi :  
while  [ men ]  come to fight with the Chaldeans ,  and to fill them with the dead bodies of men ,  whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath ,  and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city : 	  “  Ka thinur nasa tak avângin anni chu ka hrem a ,  Kaldai - hote an beihlêt avângin an ruangte chuan khawpui hi ka tikhat ang .  An sualna nasa tak avângin he khawpui hi ka hawisan tawh si a .  
Behold ,  I will bring it health and cure ,  and I will cure them ;  and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth . 	Nimahsela ,  damna leh hrisêlna ka pe leh thuai ang a ,  ka mite chu ka tidam ang a ,  thlamuang tak leh him takin ka awmtîr ang .  
I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return ,  and will build them ,  as at the first . 	Juda leh Israel chu an saltânna ata ka hruai kîr leh ang a ,  tûnhmaa an awm dân ang khân ka awmtîr leh ang .  
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity ,  by which they have sinned against me ;  and I will pardon all their iniquities ,  by which they have sinned against me ,  and by which they have transgressed against me . 	Ka laka an sualna leh khawlohna ka sil fai ang a ,  ka laka an helna te ,  an sualna leh khawlohna zawng zawngte ka ngaidam vek ang .  
 [ This city ]  shall be to me for a name of joy ,  for a praise and for a glory ,  before all the nations of the earth ,  which shall hear all the good that I do to them ,  and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure to it . 	He khawpui hi thil ṭha ka tihsak tih hretu khawvêl hnam tinrêng mit hmuhah mi tihlimtu ,  mi tilâwmtu leh mi chawimawitu a ni ang a ,  thil ṭha tam tak leh hausakna nasa taka ka vûr avângin chûngho chuan anni chu an hlau vang a ,  an khûr ang . ” 
Thus says Yahweh :  Yet again there shall be heard in this place ,  about which you say ,  It is waste ,  without man and without animal ,  even in the cities of Judah ,  and in the streets of Jerusalem ,  that are desolate ,  without man and without inhabitant and without animal , 	Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :    “  He hmun ram tawh ,  mihring leh ran awm tawh lohna tia an sawi ṭhin leh Judai ram khawpui te ,  Jerusalem kawtthlêr ram tawh ,  mihring leh ran awm lohna an tihahte chuan ,  
the voice of joy and the voice of gladness ,  the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride ,  the voice of those who say ,  Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies ,  for Yahweh is good ,  for his loving kindness endures forever ;   [ and of them ]  who bring  [ sacrifices of ]  thanksgiving into the house of Yahweh .  For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first ,  says Yahweh . 	hlim leh lâwm ri te ,  mo leh moneitu thâwm te ,  Lalpa ina lâwmna inthawina rite hriat a ni ang ,  hetiangin :   ‘ Engkim Lalpa hnênah lâwmthu hril ula ,  Lalpa chu a ṭha a ,  Kumkhuain ngil a nei dâwn si a , ’ tiin .    “  Tûnhma ang khân ram chu ka dinthar leh dâwn , ” Lalpa chuan a ti .  
Thus says Yahweh of Armies :  Yet again shall there be in this place ,  which is waste ,  without man and without animal ,  and in all its cities ,  a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down . 	Engkim Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :    “  He hmun leh khawpui ram tawh mihring leh ran awm tawh lohnaah hian berâmpute chu an berâm rual nên an awm leh ang .  
In the cities of the hill country ,  in the cities of the lowland ,  and in the cities of the South ,  and in the land of Benjamin ,  and in the places about Jerusalem ,  and in the cities of Judah ,  shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them ,  says Yahweh . 	Tlângram khawpuiah te ,  thlang lam tuipui kam khawpuiah te ,  chhim lam khawpuiah te ,  Benjamin bialah te ,  Jerusalem vêlah te ,  Judai ram khawpuiah te berâmputen an berâm an chhiar leh mawlh mawlh tawh ang , ” Lalpa chuan a ti .  
Behold ,  the days come ,  says Yahweh ,  that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah . 	  “  Ngai teh ,  nite a lo thleng mêk e , ” tih hi Lalpa thuchhuak a ni .    “  Juda chhûngte leh Israel chhûngte hnêna thu ka tiam tawh chu ka hlen ang .  
In those days ,  and at that time ,  will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David ;  and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land . 	Chûng hunahte chuan Davida thlah aṭangin lal ṭha tak ka chawr chhuahtîr ang a ,  ani chuan ram pumah dik tak leh fel takin ro a rêl ang .  
In those days shall Judah be saved ,  and Jerusalem shall dwell safely ;  and this is  [ the name ]  by which she shall be called :  Yahweh our righteousness . 	Chûng hunah chuan Juda chu a him ang a ,  Jerusalem pawh thlamuang takin a awm ang .  Chu lal chu a hming atân ,   ‘ Lalpa chu kan dikna , ’ tih a ni ang . ” 
For thus says Yahweh :  David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel ; 	Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :    “  Davida chuan Israel chhûngte zîngah a lalṭhutthlênga ṭhu tûr mi a tlachham lo vang .  
neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings ,  and to burn meal offerings ,  and to do sacrifice continually . 	Levia chi ,  puithiamte pawhin ka hnêna hâlral thilhlan inthawina tûr an tlachham hek lo vang .  
The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah ,  saying , 	Lalpa thu chu Jeremia hnênah hetiangin a lo thleng a :  
Thus says Yahweh :  If you can break my covenant of the day ,  and my covenant of the night ,  so that there shall not be day and night in their season ; 	Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :    “  Chhûn leh zân awm tûrin thu ka thlung a ,  An hun bi vawng tlat tûrin thu ka thlung a ,  Chu thuthlung chu in tihdanglam theih chuan ,  
then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant ,  that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne ;  and with the Levites the priests ,  my ministers . 	Ka chhiahhlawh Davida hnêna ka thuthlung ,   ‘ A thlahte an lal zêl tûr thu’ leh  ‘ Levia chi puithiamten ka rawng an bâwl zêl ang , ’ Ti - a thu ka thlun pawh a thlâwn a ni ang .  
As the army of the sky can ' t be numbered ,  neither the sand of the sea measured ;  so will I multiply the seed of David my servant ,  and the Levites who minister to me . 	Ka chhiahhlawh Davida thlahte leh ka rawng min bâwlsaktu Levia chite chu vâna arsi chhiar sên rual loh leh Tuipui kama ṭiau chhiar sên rual loh zâtin ka tipung ang . ” 
The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah ,  saying , 	Lalpa thu chu Jeremia hnênah hetiang hian a lo thleng a :  
Don ' t consider what this people has spoken ,  saying ,  The two families which Yahweh did choose ,  he has cast them off  ?   thus do they despise my people ,  that they should be no more a nation before them . 	 ‘ Chhûngkaw hnih ,  Lalpa thlante chu paihthlâk an ni ta’ tia hêng miten an sawi chu ,  
Thus says Yahweh :  If my covenant of day and night fails ,  if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth ; 	Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :    “  Chhûn leh zân awm tûra ka thu thlung hi a ngheh lohva ,  lei leh vân awm dân tûr ka ruat hi a nghet lo a nih chuan ,  
then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob ,  and of David my servant ,  so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham ,  Isaac ,  and Jacob :  for I will cause their captivity to return ,  and will have mercy on them . 	Jakoba thlahte leh ka chhiahhlawh Davida chu ka paihthla ang a ,  an fate chu Abrahama thlahte ,  Isaka thlahte ,  Jakoba thlahte chunga rorêltu atân ka thlang lo vang .  Anni chu ka tungding leh ang a ,  ka khawngaih dâwn si a , ” tiin . 
Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal clothing ,  and stood in the inner court of the king ' s house ,  next to the king ' s house .  The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house ,  next to the entrance of the house . 	Ni thum chaw a nghei ni chuan Estheri chuan lal thuam a inbel a ,  lal pindan hual chhûng tual ,  lalṭhutthlêng awmna kawtah chuan a kal a .  Kawngka hawi zâwngin lalṭhutthlêngah chuan lal chu a lo ṭhu a .  
When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court ,  she obtained favor in his sight ;  and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand .  So Esther came near ,  and touched the top of the scepter . 	Lalin pâwna lalnu Estheri ding chu a hmu a ,  a lo khawngaih a ,  a rangkachak laltiang chu a lekchhuahsak a ,  Estheri chuan a va pan a ,  a tiang hmâwr chu a va khawih a ,  
Then the king asked her ,   " What would you like ,  queen Esther  ?   What is your request  ?   It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom .  " 	  “  Lalnu Esther ,  eng nge ni i duh min hrilh teh ,  ka ram chanve pawh ni se ka pe ang che , ” a lo ti a .  
Esther said ,   " If it seems good to the king ,  let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him .  " 	Estheri chuan a chhâng a ,    “  Lalin rem i tih chuan zâninah Hamana nên ka ruai siamsak che rawn ei teh u , ” a ti a .  
Then the king said ,   " Bring Haman quickly ,  so that it may be done as Esther has said .  "  So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared . 	Lal chuan Hamana chu lalnu ruai kîl tûra lo kal vat tûrin a chah a ,  Lal leh Hamana chu lalnu ruai kîl tûr chuan an kal ta a .  
The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine ,   " What is your petition  ?   It shall be granted you .  What is your request  ?   Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .  " 	Uain an in laiin lal chuan ,    “  Eng nge i duh ,  ka ram chanve hial pawh ni se ka pe ang che , ” a ti leh a .  
Then Esther answered and said ,   " My petition and my request is this . 	Estheri chuan ,  
If I have found favor in the sight of the king ,  and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request ,  let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them ,  and I will do tomorrow as the king has said .  " 	  “  Lalin min khawngaiha ,  ka thil dîl tûr chu i phal dâwn chuan naktûk zânah ruai ka lo buatsaih leh ang a ,  Hamana nên rawn ei leh ula ka lo hrilh ang che , ” a ti a .   
Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart ,  but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king ' s gate ,  that he didn ' t stand up nor move for him ,  he was filled with wrath against Mordecai . 	Hamana ruai ṭheh zo chu rilru hlim tak leh lâwm takin a haw a ;  mahse ,  Mordekaia chu lal in hual chhûng kawngka bulah a hmu a ,  zah derna lantîr tûrin din pawh a lo ding duh lo va ;  a han hmuh chuan Hamana chu a thinur ta hle a .  
Nevertheless Haman restrained himself ,  and went home .  There ,  he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife . 	A insûm a ,  a haw ta a .  A ṭhiante leh a nupui Zeresi a kohtîr a .  
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches ,  the multitude of his children ,  all the things in which the king had promoted him ,  and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king . 	A hausakzia te ,  fapa a ngahzia te ,  lalin a kaisântîr thu te ,  lalin milian dang aia a ngaihsânzia te sawiin a ina lêng tûra a sâwm a ṭhiante chu a uankhum a .  
Haman also said ,   " Yes ,  Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself ;  and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king . 	  “  Lalnu meuh pawhin lal leh kei chauh a ruai chhim tûrin min sâwm a ni ,  naktûk zân atân pawh min sâwm dêr tawh .  
Yet all this avails me nothing ,  so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king ' s gate .  " 	Amaherawhchu ,  lal in luhna kawngkaa Mordekaia ṭhu ka hmuh chhûng chu hêng hi engah mah ka ngai lo , ” a ti a .  
Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him ,   " Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high ,  and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it .  Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet .  "  This pleased Haman ,  so he had the gallows made . 	A nupui leh a ṭhiante chuan ,    “  Tawng sawmngaa sâng ,  khaihlumna tûr ban phuntîr la ,  naktûk zîngah lal hnênah Mordekaia chu khai hlum dîl la ,  hlim takin ruai chu i kîl thei mai ang chu , ” an ti a .  Hamana chuan ṭha a ti hle a ,  inkhai hlumna tûr chu a siamtîr ta a . 
Now Jethro ,  the priest of Midian ,  Moses '  father - in - law ,  heard of all that God had done for Moses ,  and for Israel his people ,  how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt . 	Midian - ho puithiam ,  Jethroa ,  Mosia puzawn chuan ,  Mosia leh a mite tâna Pathianin thil a tihsak ,  Lalpa ngeiin Israel - te Aigupta ram ata a hruai chhuah thute chu a lo hria a . 
Jethro ,  Moses '  father - in - law ,  received Zipporah ,  Moses '  wife ,  after he had sent her away , 	Mosia puzawn Jethroa chuan Mosia nupui Zipori ,  in lama a hnutchhiah kha ,  a fapa pahnih nên a rawn hruai a .  
and her two sons .  The name of one son was Gershom ,  for Moses said ,   " I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land "  . 	A fapa upa zâwk chu Gersoma a ni ,   ‘ ram dangah mikhual ka ni’ a tihna a ni .  
The name of the other was Eliezer ,  for he said ,   " My father ' s God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh ' s sword .  " 	Pakhat zâwk hming chu Eliezara a ni ,   ‘ ka pate Pathian chuan min pui ta a ,  Farawa khandaih lakah min chhanhim’ a tihna a ni .  
Jethro ,  Moses '  father - in - law ,  came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped ,  at the Mountain of God . 	Pathian tlângah ,  bûk an khuarnaah chuan ,  Mosia puzawn chuan a fapa pahnih leh a nupui chu a rawn hruaisak a . 
He said to Moses ,   " I ,  your father - in - law Jethro ,  have come to you with your wife ,  and her two sons with her .  " 	Mosia hnênah ,    “  Kei i puzawn ,  Jethroa hian ka rawn tlawh dâwn a che ,  i fapa pahnih leh i nupui pawh ka rawn hruai e , ” a rawn ti a .  
Moses went out to meet his father - in - law ,  and bowed and kissed him .  They asked each other of their welfare ,  and they came into the tent . 	Mosia chu a puzawn hmuak tûrin a chhuak a ,  a kûn a ,  chibai a bûk a ,  an dam leh dam loh te an inzâwt a ;  puan inah chuan an lût dûn ta a .  
Moses told his father - in - law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel ' s sake ,  all the hardships that had come on them on the way ,  and how Yahweh delivered them . 	Israel - te avânga Farawa leh Aigupta mite chunga Lalpa thil tih zawng zawng chu Mosian a puzawn chu a hrilh a ;  kalkawnga harsatna an tawh laka Lalpa chuan a chhanhim ṭhin dânte pawh a hrilh a .  
Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel ,  in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians . 	Aigupta mite kut ata leh Farawa kut ata Israel - te a chhan chhuak a ,  an chunga a ṭhat êm avângin Lalpa chungah chuan Jethroa chu a lâwm ta êm êm a .  
Jethro said ,   " Blessed be Yahweh ,  who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians ,  and out of the hand of Pharaoh ;  who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians . 	  “  Aigupta mite kut ata leh Farawa kut ata chhanchhuaktu che u Lalpa chu fakin awm rawh se .  
Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them .  " 	Israel mite chuti taka hmusita an sawisak lai a chhan tâk avângin Lalpa chu pathian dang zawng zawng aiin a ropui zâwk tih ka hre ta , ” a ti a .  
Jethro ,  Moses '  father - in - law ,  took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God .  Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel ,  to eat bread with Moses '  father - in - law before God . 	Mosia puzawn Jethroa chuan Pathian hnênah hâlral thilhlan leh inthawinate a hlân a .  Arona leh Israel upa zawng zawngte chu Pathian hmaa Mosia puzawn inthawina chawhlui kîl tûr chuan an lo kal a . 
It happened on the next day ,  that Moses sat to judge the people ,  and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening . 	A tûkah chuan Mosia chu mite thu rem tûrin a ṭhu a ,  mite chuan Mosia chu zîng aṭangin tlai thlengin an din hual a .  
When Moses '  father - in - law saw all that he did to the people ,  he said ,   " What is this thing that you do for the people  ?   Why do you sit alone ,  and all the people stand around you from morning to evening  ?   " 	Mosia puzawn chuan mipui ro a rêlsak dân chu a hmu a ,    “  Engtizia nge mipui tân hetianga ro i rêl  ?   Nangmah vekin rêl tumin i ṭhu a ,  zîng aṭanga tlai thlengin an din hual che hi , ” a ti a .  
Moses said to his father - in - law ,   " Because the people come to me to inquire of God . 	Mosian a puzawn hnênah chuan ,    “  Pathian râwn tûrin mite hi ka hnênah an lo kal alâwm .  
When they have a matter ,  they come to me ,  and I judge between a man and his neighbor ,  and I make them know the statutes of God ,  and his laws .  " 	Thu pawi an neihin ka hnênah an rawn thlen miau si ṭhîn a ,  an ṭhenawmte nêna an inkâr thu ka lo rêl felsak ṭhîn a ni .  Pathian thuruatte leh a dânte ka lo hrilh ṭhîn a ni , ” a ti a .  
Moses '  father - in - law said to him ,   " The thing that you do is not good . 	Mosia puzawn chuan ,    “  I thil tih dân hi a ṭha hauh lo mai .  
You will surely wear away ,  both you ,  and this people that is with you ;  for the thing is too heavy for you .  You are not able to perform it yourself alone . 	Nang leh hêng mite hi in intichau ngei ang ;  he hna hi i tân a hautak lutuk ,  nangmah mai chuan i thawk sêng lo vang .  
Listen now to my voice .  I will give you counsel ,  and God be with you .  You represent the people before God ,  and bring the causes to God . 	Ka thu hi ngaithla la ,  thurâwn ka han pe ang che a ,  Pathianin a awmpui ang che .  Mipui aiawha Pathian hnêna kala ,  an thu Pathian hnêna thlentu tûr i ni .  
You shall teach them the statutes and the laws ,  and shall show them the way in which they must walk ,  and the work that they must do . 	Pathian thuruatte leh a dânte chu i zirtîr ang a ,  an awm dân tûr leh an tih tûr i kawhhmuh ṭhîn tûr a ni .  
Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men ,  such as fear God :  men of truth ,  hating unjust gain ;  and place such over them ,  to be rulers of thousands ,  rulers of hundreds ,  rulers of fifties ,  and rulers of tens . 	Mipui zîng ata mi fel deuh deuh ,  Pathian ṭih mi ,  thu dik ngaina ,  hlêprûk haw mi thlang chhuak la ,  sâng chin chunga rorêl tûr te ,  za chin chunga rorêl tûr te ,  sawmnga chin chunga rorêl tûr te ,  sâwm chin chunga rorêl tûr te ruat rawh .  
Let them judge the people at all times .  It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you ,  but every small matter they shall judge themselves .  So shall it be easier for you ,  and they shall share the load with you . 	Chûng chu rorêltu nghet ni rawh se ,  thu tênau chu rêl zêl sela ,  thu lian deuh erawh chu i hnên lo thleng ṭhîn rawh se ;  tichuan ,  an chhâwk zâng ang chia ,  i hahdam deuh thei ang .  
If you will do this thing ,  and God commands you so ,  then you will be able to endure ,  and all of these people also will go to their place in peace .  " 	Pathian thupêk anga chutianga i tih chuan i intichau lo vang a ,  mipui lah an zângkhai ang a ,  an thu an rem fel thuai thuai ang a ,  an haw mai thei ṭhîn ang , ” a ti a .  
So Moses listened to the voice of his father - in - law ,  and did all that he had said . 	Tichuan ,  a puzawn thu chu Mosia chuan a zâwm a ,  a sawi ang chuan a ti ta a .  
Moses chose able men out of all Israel ,  and made them heads over the people ,  rulers of thousands ,  rulers of hundreds ,  rulers of fifties ,  and rulers of tens . 	Israel - te zînga a fel fel Mosian a thlang chhuak a ,  mipuite hotu - ah a ruat a ;  sâng hotu tûr te ,  za hotu tûr te ,  sawmnga hotu tûr te ,  sâwm hotu tûr te a ruat ta a .  
They judged the people at all times .  They brought the hard causes to Moses ,  but every small matter they judged themselves . 	Eng lai pawhin mite chu ro an rêlsak a ,  thu lian erawh chu Mosia hnênah an thlen a ,  thu tenau chu an rêl fel mai a ni .  
Moses let his father - in - law depart ,  and he went his way into his own land . 	Mosia chuan a puzawn chu a va thlah a ,  Jethroa chu an ram lamah a haw leh ta a . 
The Canaanite ,  the king of Arad ,  who lived in the South ,  heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim ;  and he fought against Israel ,  and took some of them captive . 	Kanan ram chhim lama Kanan mi Arad lal chuan Israel - te chu Atharim lamah an lo kal tih a hriatin a lo bei a ,  mi ṭhenkhat chu a man a .  
Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh ,  and said ,   " If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand ,  then I will utterly destroy their cities .  " 	Israel - ho chuan Lalpa hnênah thu an intiamkam a .    “  Hêng mite hi min hnehtîr chuan i tân an khuate lamin kan hlân vek ang a ,  kan tiboral vek ang , ” an ti a .  
Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel ,  and delivered up the Canaanites ;  and they utterly destroyed them and their cities :  and the name of the place was called Hormah . 	Lalpa chuan a lo hria a ,  chûng Kanan mite chu a hnehtîr a .  Israel - te chuan an that vek a ,  an khuate pawh chu an tichhe vek a ,  a hmun hmingah Horma an vuah a .   
They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea ,  to compass the land of Edom :  and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way . 	Hor tlâng aṭang chuan an kal zêl a ,  Edom ram hêlna ,  Tuipui Sen kawng lamah chuan an kal a ,  a kawng a kual avângin an ning a .  
The people spoke against God ,  and against Moses ,   " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness  ?   For there is no bread ,  and there is no water ;  and our soul loathes this light bread .  " 	Mipui chu Pathian leh Mosia lakah an vui a ,    “  Engah kher nge Aigupta ram ata he thlalêra thi mai tûra min hruai chhuah  ?   Chaw a awm si lo ,  tui lah a awm hek lo ,  he mana chhang teivet lah hi kan ning hlui tawh si , ” an ti a . 
Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people ,  and they bit the people ;  and many people of Israel died . 	Lalpa chuan rûl chuk na tak a tipuang a ,  Israel mi tam tak chu an chu hlum a .  
The people came to Moses ,  and said ,   " We have sinned ,  because we have spoken against Yahweh ,  and against you .  Pray to Yahweh ,  that he take away the serpents from us .  "  Moses prayed for the people . 	Mipui chu Mosia hnênah an lo kal a ,    “  Thil sual kan ti a ni ,  Lalpa chungah leh i chungah kan vai hian thil dik lo kan ti a ni ;  rûl tirêm tûr hian Lalpa min ngensak rawh , ” an ti a .  Mosian mipui chu a ṭawngṭaisak a .  
Yahweh said to Moses ,   " Make a fiery serpent ,  and set it on a standard :  and it shall happen ,  that everyone who is bitten ,  when he sees it ,  shall live .  " 	Lalpa chuan Mosia hnênah ,    “  Dârin rûl lem siam la ,  mi tin hmuh theih tûrin thingtlâwn lêrah khai rawh ;  rûl chuk apiangin chu chu an en chuan an dam zêl ang , ” a ti a .  
Moses made a serpent of brass ,  and set it on the standard :  and it happened ,  that if a serpent had bitten any man ,  when he looked to the serpent of brass ,  he lived . 	Mosia chuan dârin rûl lem a siam a ,  thingtlâwn lêrah a khai a ,  rûl chuk apiangin dâr rûl chu an en phawt chuan an dam ta zêl a .   
The children of Israel traveled ,  and encamped in Oboth . 	Israel - te chu an kal zêl a .  Obot - ah bûk an khuar a ;  chu hmun chu an chhuahsan a , 
They traveled from Oboth ,  and encamped at Iyeabarim ,  in the wilderness which is before Moab ,  toward the sunrise . 	Moab ram chhak lam thlalêrah Abarim khaw ramah bûk an khuar leh a .  
From there they traveled ,  and encamped in the valley of Zered . 	Zered ruamah bûk an khuar leh a ,  
From there they traveled ,  and encamped on the other side of the Arnon ,  which is in the wilderness ,  that comes out of the border of the Amorites :  for the Arnon is the border of Moab ,  between Moab and the Amorites . 	chuta ṭang chuan an insawn leh a ,  Arnon lui hmâr lamah bûk an khuar leh a ;  Arnon lui chu Amor ram dep thlenga awm a ni ,  Amor leh Moab ramri lui a ni .  
Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Yahweh ,   " Vaheb in Suphah ,  the valleys of the Arnon , 	He lai ram hi  ‘ Lalpa indona’ tih lehkhabu - ah chuan  ‘ Sufa ruama Vahep khua Arnon ruam te ,  
the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar ,  leans on the border of Moab .  " 	Ar khaw lama thluang ,  Moab ri dep ram awihtlân pangpêr , ’ tih a ni .  
From there they traveled to Beer :  that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses ,   " Gather the people together ,  and I will give them water .  " 	Chuta ṭang chuan Beer an tih chu an thleng a ;  chu hmun chu tuichhunchhuah awmna a ni .  Lalpa chuan ,    “  Mipui ko khâwm rawh ,  tui ka pe dâwn , ” a ti a ,  chu tuichhunchhuah chu a pe a nih kha .  
Then sang Israel this song :   " Spring up ,  well ;  sing to it : 	Israel - te chuan he hla hi an sa a ,   ‘ Aw tuichhunchhuah ,  lo chik chhuak teh ,  Zaiin kan lo awi ang che .  
the well ,  which the princes dug ,  which the nobles of the people dug ,  with the scepter ,  and with their poles .  "  From the wilderness  [ they traveled ]  to Mattanah ; 	Mi lian leh hnam hruaitute laih Lal tiang leh talhfiak leka an laih chu , ’ tiin .  Thlalêr aṭang chuan Matana - ah an insawn a .  
and from Mattanah to Nahaliel ;  and from Nahaliel to Bamoth ; 	Nahaliel - ah an kal zêl a ,  Bamot an thleng a .  
and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab ,  to the top of Pisgah ,  which looks down on the desert . 	Bamot aṭang chuan Moab ram phai ,  Pisga tlâng ṭhut an thleng a .  Chu tlângchhîp aṭang chuan thlalêr chu a lang vek a ni .   
Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites ,  saying , 	Israel fate chuan Amor lal Sihona hnênah palai an tîr a .  
 " Let me pass through your land :  we will not turn aside into field ,  or into vineyard ;  we will not drink of the water of the wells :  we will go by the king ' s highway ,  until we have passed your border .  " 	  “  I ramah kan kal tlang ang e ,  kan rante nên in lovah te ,  in grep hmunahte kawngpui ata kan pêng lo vang a ,  in tuichhunchhuah tui pawh kan chawi lo vang ,  in ram kan pelh hma chu Lamlianpuiah chauh kan kal ang , ” an ti a .  
Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border :  but Sihon gathered all his people together ,  and went out against Israel into the wilderness ,  and came to Jahaz ;  and he fought against Israel . 	Sihona chuan Israel - ten an ram an kal tlang chu a lo phal bîk awzâwng lo va ,  lo dang tûrin a mite a khâwm a ,  thlalêr Jahaz hmunah a lo kal a ,  Israel - te chu a lo bei a .  
Israel struck him with the edge of the sword ,  and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok ,  even to the children of Ammon ;  for the border of the children of Ammon was strong . 	Israel - te chuan an lo that ṭeuh va ,  an ram hmâr lam ,  Arnon lui aṭanga Jabok lui thlengin an neihsak ta a .  Jabok hmâr lam chu Amon mite ram a ni ;  anni chuan an ramri chu an lo vêng hneh hle a ni .  
Israel took all these cities :  and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites ,  in Heshbon ,  and in all its towns . 	Israel - te chuan Amor - ho khawpuite chu an la vek a ;  khawpuiahte chuan Israel - te chu an awm ta a .  Hesbon leh a chhehvêl khuate pawh an luahsak vek a .  
For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites ,  who had fought against the former king of Moab ,  and taken all his land out of his hand ,  even to the Arnon . 	Hesbon chu Amor lal Sihona khawpui a ni .  Tûn hmain Moab lal nên an inbei a ,  Arnon lui thlengin Moab ram chu a lo chhuhsak tawh a ni .  
Therefore those who speak in proverbs say ,   " Come to Heshbon .  Let the city of Sihon be built and established ; 	Chuvângin ,  hetiangin hla an phuah a :  Sihona khawpui Hesbon - ah lo kal ula ,  I din ṭhain i sa ṭha leh ang u ;  
for a fire has gone out of Heshbon ,  a flame from the city of Sihon .  It has devoured Ar of Moab ,  The lords of the high places of the Arnon . 	Hesbon aṭangin mei a chhuak a ,  Sihona khawpui chu a kâng a ,  Moab ram Ar khua a kai a ,  Arnon lui hmârthlang ramte chu a kâng fai e .  
Woe to you ,  Moab !  You are undone ,  people of Chemosh !  He has given his sons as fugitives ,  and his daughters into captivity ,  to Sihon king of the Amorites . 	Moab mite tak chu aw !  Khemosa betute chu an chhe zo ta ,  A betute chu an râltlân a ;  A fanute chu salah an man ,  Amor lal Sihona hote chuan .  
We have shot at them .  Heshbon has perished even to Dibon .  We have laid waste even to Nophah ,  Which reaches to Medeba .  " 	Hesbon chu a chhe ta ,  Dibon thlengin thalin kan kâp ;  Nofa thlengin kan tiram ,  Medeba bula awm chu .  
Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites . 	Israel - te chu Amor ramah chuan an awm ta a .  
Moses sent to spy out Jazer ;  and they took its towns ,  and drove out the Amorites who were there . 	Jazer khaw beih dân tûr en thlithlai tûrin Mosian mi a tîr a .  Israel - te chuan a chhehvêl khuate nên an la a ,  chûng khuaa awm Amor mite chu an hnawt chhuak vek a .  
They turned and went up by the way of Bashan :  and Og the king of Bashan went out against them ,  he and all his people ,  to battle at Edrei . 	An lo kual a ,  Basan lal Oga chuan lo dan a tum a ,  a mite a pun ṭeuh va .  Edrei hmunah Israel - te chu a va bei a .  
Yahweh said to Moses ,   " Don ' t fear him :  for I have delivered him into your hand ,  and all his people ,  and his land ;  and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites ,  who lived at Heshbon .  " 	Lalpa chuan Mosia hnênah ,    “  Ani chu hlau suh ,  a mi zawng zawngte leh a ram chu i kutah ka pe tawh a che ;  Hesbon khaw lal Sihona chunga i tih ang khân a chungah pawh ti ang che , ” a ti a . 
So they struck him ,  and his sons and all his people ,  until there was none left him remaining :  and they possessed his land . 	Tichuan ,  ani chu a fate nên an that a ,  a mite pawh bâng awm miah lovin an tihlum a ,  a ram chu an neihsak ta a . 
Dinah ,  the daughter of Leah ,  whom she bore to Jacob ,  went out to see the daughters of the land . 	Leaiin Jakoba a hrinsak Dinaii chu ,  chu ram nulate tlawh tûrin a lêng a .  
Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite ,  the prince of the land ,  saw her .  He took her ,  lay with her ,  and humbled her . 	Chu lai mite hotupa chu Hiv mi ,  Hamora a ni .  A fapa Sekeman ani chu a lo man a ,  a mutpui lui a . 
His soul joined to Dinah ,  the daughter of Jacob ,  and he loved the young lady ,  and spoke kindly to the young lady . 	Jakoba fanu Dinaii chu a ngaizâwng êm êm a ,  tihlâwm a tum ta a .  
Shechem spoke to his father ,  Hamor ,  saying ,   " Get me this young lady as a wife .  " 	Sekema chuan a pa hnênah ,    “  Nula hi mi neihsak rawh , ” a ti ta tlut tlut a .  
Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah ,  his daughter ;  and his sons were with his livestock in the field .  Jacob held his peace until they came . 	Jakoba chuan a fanu Dinaii chu Sekeman a lo tibawrhbâng tih a lo hria a ,  a fate kha ramhnuaiah ran rual nên an awm lai a ni a ;  an lo haw hma chu a ngawi mai a .  
Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him . 	Jakoba fanu dîl tûr chuan Sekema pa Hamora chu a lo kal a .  
The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it .  The men were grieved ,  and they were very angry ,  because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob ' s daughter ;  a which thing ought not to be done . 	Chutih lai chuan Jakoba fate chu ram aṭangin an lo haw a ,  chanchin an han hriat chuan an so sa phut a ,  an thin a ur ta êm êm a .  Sekeman Jakoba fanu a lo pâwngsual mai chu Israel - te zîngah tih thiang lo a ni a ,  ngawihpui mai mai chi a ni lo .  
Hamor talked with them ,  saying ,   " The soul of my son ,  Shechem ,  longs for your daughter .  Please give her to him as a wife . 	Hamora chuan an hnênah ,    “  Ka fapa Sekema chuan in fanu hi duh tak têin a duh tlat a ni .  Khawngaih takin neihtîr hrâm teh u .  
Make marriages with us .  Give your daughters to us ,  and take our daughters for yourselves . 	Inneih pawlh ila a ṭha ang .  In fanute min neihtîr ula ,  kan fanute nei bawk ang che u .  
You shall dwell with us ,  and the land will be before you .  Live and trade in it ,  and get possessions in it .  " 	Tichuan ,  kan awm ho thei ang a ,  in duhna lai laiah in awm thei ang a ,  in duh angin in khawsa ang a ,  rante in nei thei dâwn nia , ” a ti a . 
Shechem said to her father and to her brothers ,   " Let me find favor in your eyes ,  and whatever you will tell me I will give . 	Nula pa leh a nuṭate hnênah Sekema chuan ,    “  Min khawngaih teh u ,  in phût ang ang ka ti ang e .  
Ask me a great amount for a dowry ,  and I will give whatever you ask of me ,  but give me the young lady as a wife .  " 	A man chu eng zât pawh min dîl ula ,  ka pe zêl ang che u ,  min neihtîr hrâm teh u , ” a ti a .  
The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit ,  and spoke ,  because he had defiled Dinah their sister , 	Jakoba fate chuan an farnu a tihbawrhbân avâng chuan Sekema leh a pa chu fing takin an chhâng a .  
and said to them ,   " We can ' t do this thing ,  to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised ;  for that is a reproach to us . 	  “  Kan remti thei lo ;  serh tan loh kan farnu kan neihtîr chuan kan tan thil zahthlâk a ni ang .  
Only on this condition will we consent to you .  If you will be as we are ,  that every male of you be circumcised ; 	Keimahni anga mipa zawng zawng serh in tan ve vek erawh chuan kan neihtîr thei ang che u .  
then will we give our daughters to you ,  and we will take your daughters to us ,  and we will dwell with you ,  and we will become one people . 	Tichuan ,  kan fanute in nei thei ang a ,  in fanute kan nei thei bawk ang a ,  in zîngah awmin laichîn unau kan ni thei ang .  
But if you will not listen to us ,  to be circumcised ,  then we will take our sister ,  and we will be gone .  " 	Serh in tan duh loh chuan kan farnu chu kan hruai ang a ,  kan kal daih ang , ” an ti a .  
Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem ,  Hamor ' s son . 	Hamora leh a fapa chuan an thil phût chu âwm an ti hle a .  
The young man didn ' t wait to do this thing ,  because he had delight in Jacob ' s daughter ,  and he was honored above all the house of his father . 	Jakoba fanu chu a duh êm kher a ,  tlangvâl chuan an thu chu a bawh zui ta chung chung a ;  a chipuite chuan ani chu an ngaisâng hle a ni .  
Hamor and Shechem ,  his son ,  came to the gate of their city ,  and talked with the men of their city ,  saying , 	Hamora leh a fapa Sekema chu kulh kawngkaa khaw hotute hnênah chuan an kal a ,  an khaw mite hnênah chuan ,  
 " These men are peaceful with us .  Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it .  For behold ,  the land is large enough for them .  Let us take their daughters to us for wives ,  and let us give them our daughters . 	  “  Hêngho hi nêlawm tak an ni .  Ram hi kan thâwl bawk a ,  awm ve sela ,  an duh duhin sumdâwng teh se .  An fanute nupuiah kan nei ang a ,  kan fanute pawh nupuiah nei ve rawh se .  
Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us ,  to become one people ,  if every male among us is circumcised ,  as they are circumcised . 	Hêng mite hian kan zînga awmin laichîn unau kan nih theih nân thil pakhat chauh an tih anga kan mipa zawng zawng serh tan an phût tlat a ni . 
Won ' t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours  ?   Only let us give our consent to them ,  and they will dwell with us .  " 	An ran neih zozai ,  an sum leh pai ,  an sate nên hian kan ta a ni mai dâwn asin .  Kan zînga an awm ve duh nân an phût ang chu i ti mai ang u , ” an ti a .  
All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor ,  and to Shechem his son ;  and every male was circumcised ,  all who went out of the gate of his city . 	Hamora leh a fapa Sekema thu chu mi pangngai chin chuan rem an ti a ,  an zînga mipa pangngai chin chuan serh an tan ta vek a .  
It happened on the third day ,  when they were sore ,  that two of Jacob ' s sons ,  Simeon and Levi ,  Dinah ' s brothers ,  each took his sword ,  came upon the unsuspecting city ,  and killed all the males . 	A ni thum ni ,  a nat zual lai tak chuan Dinaii nuṭa Simeona leh Levia ,  Jakoba fapa pahnih chuan an khandaih an keng a ,  tu ma lo dan lohvin khuaah chuan an lût a ,  mipa zawng zawng chu an râwt ta vek a .  
They killed Hamor and Shechem ,  his son ,  with the edge of the sword ,  and took Dinah out of Shechem ' s house ,  and went away . 	Hamora leh a fapa Sekema pawh an sât hlum a ,  Sekema in aṭang chuan Dinaii chu an la chhuak a ,  an hâwn ta a .  
Jacob ' s sons came on the dead ,  and plundered the city ,  because they had defiled their sister . 	Jakoba fa dangte chuan an mi thahte an va hmuh chuan khua chu an suam ta a ,  an farnu tihbawrhbân man phuba an la a .  
They took their flocks ,  their herds ,  their donkeys ,  that which was in the city ,  that which was in the field , 	An berâm te ,  bâwng te ,  sabengtung te ,  khaw chhûng leh pâwna an thil neih zawng zawng ,  
and all their wealth .  They took captive all their little ones and their wives ,  and took as plunder everything that was in the house . 	an sum leh pai zawng zawng chu ,  an fate leh an nupuite nên an man a ,  an in chhûnga awm zawng zawng pawh an lâksak a .  
Jacob said to Simeon and Levi ,   " You have troubled me ,  to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land ,  among the Canaanites and the Perizzites .  I am few in number .  They will gather themselves together against me and strike me ,  and I will be destroyed ,  I and my house .  " 	Jakoba chuan Simeona leh Levia hnênah ,    “  He rama chêng Kanan mite leh Periz mite tana hnawksakah min siam a ,  mi timangang hle a ni .  Kan tlêm si a ,  min rawn bei sela kan mi zawng zawngte nên hian min nuai bo ang asin , ” a ti a .  
They said ,   " Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute  ?   " 	Anni chuan ,    “  Kan farnu hi mihur anga lo sawisak tûr em ni  ?  ” tiin an chhâng a . 
My God ,  my God ,  why have you forsaken me  ?   Why are you so far from helping me ,  and from the words of my groaning  ?  	Ka Pathian ,  ka Pathian ,  engah nge mi kalsan  ?   Engati nge ṭanpuina dîla ka rûm laia hla taka i awm le  ?   
My God ,  I cry in the daytime ,  but you don ' t answer ;  in the night season ,  and am not silent . 	Ka Pathian chu chhûnahte ka au va ,  mi chhâng lo va ,  Zân a lo ni ,  ka ngawi thei chuang si lo .  
But you are holy ,  you who inhabit the praises of Israel . 	Nang zawng i thianghlim a ,  lalṭhutthlênga ṭhu ,  Israel - ten an fak ṭhîna chu i ni .  
Our fathers trusted in you .  They trusted ,  and you delivered them . 	Kan pi puten an ring che a ,  An rin vângin i chhan chhuak a .  
They cried to you ,  and were delivered .  They trusted in you ,  and were not disappointed . 	An au che a ,  i hum ṭhîn a ,  Nangmahah chuan an innghat a ,  nangin i lo chhanhim ṭhîn .  
But I am a worm ,  and no man ;  a reproach of men ,  and despised by the people . 	Kei zawng changpât ang lek ,  mihring tling lo ka ni a ,  Mî chhawnchhaih leh hmuhsit ka ni .  
All those who see me mock me .  They insult me with their lips .  They shake their heads ,  saying , 	Min hmu apiangte chuan min nuihzat a ,  An lu thingin min chhiatkhum a .  
 " He trusts in Yahweh ;  let him deliver him .  Let him rescue him ,  since he delights in him .  " 	  “  Lalpa hnênah a tlulût alâwm ,  rawn chhan ang hmiang :  A mi duhzâwng a ni a ,  rawn chhan chhuak rawh se ! ” an ti .  
But you brought me out of the womb .  You made me trust at my mother ' s breasts . 	Chhûl aṭanga mi la chhuaktu ,  Ka nu hnute ringa mi awmtleitu i ni a .  
I was thrown on you from my mother ' s womb .  You are my God since my mother bore me . 	Ka pian ata nangmah chauhva innghat ka ni a ,  Ka nu pum chhûng aṭang tawhin ka Pathian i ni .  
Don ' t be far from me ,  for trouble is near .  For there is none to help . 	Hmêlma an lo hnai e ,  min hlat lul suh ,  Ṭanpuitu dang an awm si lo .  
Many bulls have surrounded me .  Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me . 	Bâwng kawlhte chuan min hual tuau va ,  Basan bâwng huaite chuan min hual vêl e .  
They open their mouths wide against me ,  lions tearing prey and roaring . 	Sakeibaknei koham rûm angin An kâ min ânkhum a .  
I am poured out like water .  All my bones are out of joint .  My heart is like wax ;  it is melted within me . 	Tui leih buak ang ka ni ,  Ka ruhte pawh a pelh zo ta .  Ka thinlung chu khawihnûn tui ang a ni .  
My strength is dried up like a potsherd .  My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth .  You have brought me into the dust of death . 	Ka tha lah chu hlumbêl keh them angin a ro zo va ,  Ka dangah hian ka lei a bet :  Thi ang dêrin vaivutah chuan min mut a .  
For dogs have surrounded me .  A company of evildoers have enclosed me .  They have pierced my hands and feet . 	Ui angin min hual vêl a ,  Mi sual rualin min zîm a ,  Ka kutah leh ka ke - ah an chhun a .  
I can count all of my bones .  They look and stare at me . 	Ka ruhte chu ka chhiar thei e .  Anni lah chuan min en mai a ,  min thlîr reng mai .  
They divide my garments among them .  They cast lots for my clothing . 	Ka silhfênte an insem a ,  Ka kawr atân ṭhum an vâwr bawk .  
But don ' t be far off ,  Yahweh .  You are my help :  hurry to help me . 	Lalpa ,  nang chuan min hlat lul suh ,  Aw ,  min ṭanpuitu ,  lo hmanhmawh teh .  
Deliver my soul from the sword ,  my precious life from the power of the dog . 	Khandaih lakah min rawn chhan la ,  Hêng ui lakahte hian ka nunna chhanhim rawh .  
Save me from the lion ' s mouth !  Yes ,  from the horns of the wild oxen ,  you have answered me . 	Sakeibaknei kâ ata hi min chhandam la ,  Ramsial ki kâr ata min la chhuak ang che .  
I will declare your name to my brothers .  In the midst of the assembly ,  I will praise you . 	Tichuan ,  ka unaute hnênah i hming ka hril ang a ,  Pung khâwm zîngah chuan ka fak ang che .  
You who fear Yahweh ,  praise him !  All you descendants of Jacob ,  glorify him !  Stand in awe of him ,  all you descendants of Israel ! 	Lalpa ṭihtute u ,  amah chu fak rawh u ,  Jakoba thlahte u ,  chawimawi ula ,  Israela fate u ,  a hmaah kûn rawh u .  
For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted ,  Neither has he hidden his face from him ;  but when he cried to him ,  he heard . 	Retheite chu a hmusit ngai lo va ,  a ten hek lo .  Ṭanpui an dîlin a lo hria a ,  a hawisan ngai hek lo .  
Of you comes my praise in the great assembly .  I will pay my vows before those who fear him . 	Pung khâwm ropui tak zîngah ka fak ang chia ,  Nangmah ṭihtute hmaah chuan Ka thutiamte ka hlen bawk ang .  
The humble shall eat and be satisfied .  They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him .  Let your hearts live forever . 	Retheite chuan tlai takin ei sela ,  Lalpa zawngtute chuan amah chu fak rawh se .  An thinlung chu tihharh ni kumkhua bawk rawh se .  
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh .  All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you . 	Lei pum puiin Lalpa an hria ang a ,  a hnênah chi tin an kîr ang a .  A hmaah chuan hnam tin an ṭhingṭhi ang .  
For the kingdom is Yahweh ' s .  He is the ruler over the nations . 	Lalpa chu lalber a ni a ,  Hnam tin chungah ro a rêl ṭhîn .  
All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship .  All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him ,  even he who can ' t keep his soul alive . 	Inei thaute chu a hmaah an kûn ang a ,  Inchâwm nung zo lo ,  vaivuta chang tûrte pawh A hmaah chuan an ṭhingṭhi ang .  
Posterity shall serve him .  Future generations shall be told about the Lord . 	Ṭhangtharten a rawng an bâwl ang a ,  An thlahte hnênah pawh Lalpa thu hi an hril zêl ang .  
They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born ,  for he has done it .  A Psalm by David . 	  “  Lalpan a mite a chhanhim , ” tiin ,  La piang lote pawh an la hrilh ang .  
Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity ,  and to the priests ,  and to the prophets ,  and to all the people ,  whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon , 	Nebukadnezaran Jerusalem aṭanga Babulon - a a hruai ,  saltâng zînga hruaitu te ,  puithiam te ,  zâwlnei te leh mi hnêna zâwlnei Jeremia thu thawn chu hei hi a ni :  
 ( after that Jeconiah the king ,  and the queen mother ,  and the eunuchs ,   [ and ]  the princes of Judah and Jerusalem ,  and the craftsmen ,  and the smiths ,  were departed from Jerusalem )  , 	Chu chu lal Jekonia leh a nu te ,  mi tilreh te ,  Judai ram leh Jerusalem - a hotu te ,  themthiam te leh thîrdêng ten Jerusalem an chhuahsan hnu khân a ni .  
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan ,  and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah ,   ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon )  ,  saying , 	Juda lal Zedekian Babulon lal Nebukadnezara hnêna a mi tirh ,  Safana fapa Elasa leh Hilkia fapa Gemaria te kutah chu lehkha chu a thawn a ni .  Heti hian a ti :  
Thus says Yahweh of Armies ,  the God of Israel ,  to all the captivity ,  whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon : 	  “  Israel - te Pathian ,  Engkim Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :   ‘ Saltâng Jerusalem aṭanga Babulon - a ka kaltîr tâkte u ,  
Build houses ,  and dwell in them ;  and plant gardens ,  and eat the fruit of them . 	in te sa ula ;  tah chuan chêng ang che u ;  huante siam ula ,  in thlai tharte chu ei ang che u .  
Take wives ,  and father sons and daughters ;  and take wives for your sons ,  and give your daughters to husbands ,  that they may bear sons and daughters ;  and multiply there ,  and don ' t be diminished . 	Nupui nei ula ,  fanu fapate nei ang che u .  In fapate nupui neihsak ula ,  in fanute pawh pasal neihtîr ang che u .  Tichuan ,  fanu fapa neiin in lo pung ang a ,  kiam lam pan suh u .  
Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive ,  and pray to Yahweh for it ;  for in its peace you shall have peace . 	Sala ka tirhna che u khawpui ṭhatna zawnsak ula ,  Lalpa hnênah dîlsak rawh u .  Chu ram hmuingîlna zâr chu nangni pawhin in zo ve dâwn si a . ’
For thus says Yahweh of Armies ,  the God of Israel :  Don ' t let your prophets who are in the midst of you ,  and your diviners ,  deceive you ;  neither listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed . 	Engkim Lalpa ,  Israel - te Pathian chuan heti hian a ti :   ‘ In zînga zâwlnei te ,  aienthiam te chuan bum che u suh se .  An mumangte pawh ngaithla suh u .  
For they prophesy falsely to you in my name :  I have not sent them ,  says Yahweh . 	Ka hmingin dâwt an hrilh che u a ,  anni chu ka tirh an ni hauh si lo , ’ tih hi Lalpa thuchhuak a ni .  
For thus says Yahweh ,  After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon ,  I will visit you ,  and perform my good word toward you ,  in causing you to return to this place . 	  “  Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :   ‘ Kum sawmsarih a tlin hunah Babulon ramah chuan ka rawn tlawh ang che u a ,  in hnêna ka thutiam nghet tak chu ka hlen ang a ,  he hmunah hian ka hruai kîr leh ang che u .  
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you ,  says Yahweh ,  thoughts of peace ,  and not of evil ,  to give you hope and a future . 	In tâna ka remruat chu keimah chauhvin ka hria , ’ tih hi Lalpa thu chhuak a ni .   ‘ Chhiatna ni lo ,  thil ṭha in beisei chu in chan theih nân ka ruahman a ni .  
You shall call on me ,  and you shall go and pray to me ,  and I will listen to you . 	Min lam ang a ,  ka hnênah in rawn ṭawngṭai ang a ,  ka lo ngaithla ang che u .  
You shall seek me ,  and find me ,  when you shall search for me with all your heart . 	Min zawng ang a ,  tihtakzeta min zawn hunah min hmu ang .  
I will be found by you ,  says Yahweh ,  and I will turn again your captivity ,  and I will gather you from all the nations ,  and from all the places where I have driven you ,  says Yahweh ;  and I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive . 	In hmuh tûrin ka awm ang , ’ tih hi Lalpa thuchhuak a ni .  Sal ata ka chhuah ang che u a ,  ka hnawhdarhna ram hnam leh hmun tinrêng aṭangin ka hruai khâwm leh ang che u , ’ tih hi Lalpa thuchhuak a ni .  
Because you have said ,  Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon ; 	  “    ‘ Lalpa chuan Babulon - ah pawh zâwlneite min siamsak a , ’ in ti vei a .  
thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne of David ,  and concerning all the people who dwell in this city ,  your brothers who haven ' t gone forth with you into captivity ; 	Lalpa chuan Davida lalṭhutthlênga ṭhu tûr lal chungchâng te ,  he khawpuia chêng mipui chungchâng te ,  in unau ,  in hnêna sala tâng ve lote chungchâng thu heti hian a sawi :  
thus says Yahweh of Armies ;  Behold ,  I will send on them the sword ,  the famine ,  and the pestilence ,  and will make them like vile figs ,  that can ' t be eaten ,  they are so bad . 	 ‘ Ngai teh ,  an chungah khandaih te ,  ṭâm te ,  hripui te ka lêntîr dâwn e .  Anni chu theipui ṭawih ,  ei tlâk loh khawpa chhia ang hian ka siam ang .  
I will pursue after them with the sword ,  with the famine ,  and with the pestilence ,  and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth ,  to be an object of horror ,  and an astonishment ,  and a hissing ,  and a reproach ,  among all the nations where I have driven them ; 	Anni chu khandaih te ,  tâm te ,  hripui te nên ka ûmzui ang .  Ka hnawhdarhna hnam tin zîngah leia lalram zawng zawngten thil râpthlâk leh ânchhia ,  mak an tiha an chek khum tlawk tlawkah leh an nuihzat huai huaiah ka siam ang .  
because they have not listened to my words ,  says Yahweh ,  with which I sent to them my servants the prophets ,  rising up early and sending them ;  but you would not hear ,  says Yahweh . 	In hnêna zing tak taka ka tirh ,  ka chhiahhlawh zâwlneite thu in pawisa lo va ,  in ngaithla duh si lo , ’ tih hi Lalpa thuchhuak a ni .  
Hear therefore the word of Yahweh ,  all you of the captivity ,  whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon . 	Nangni ,  saltâng Jerusalem aṭanga Babulon - a ka hruaite u ,  Lalpa thu hi ngaithla rawh u .  
Thus says Yahweh of Armies ,  the God of Israel ,  concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah ,  and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah ,  who prophesy a lie to you in my name :  Behold ,  I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ;  and he shall kill them before your eyes ; 	Israel - te Pathian ,  Engkim Lalpa chuan Kolaia fapa Ahaba leh Maaseia fapa Zedekia ,  ka hminga dâwt thu puang ṭhînte chungchâng heti hian a sawi :   ‘ Ngai teh ,  anni chu Babulon lal Nebukadnezara ka mantîr ang a ,  in hmuh lai ngeiin a that ang .  
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon ,  saying ,  Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab ,  whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire ; 	Judai ram aṭanga Babulon - a saltâng zawng zawngte chuan ,   ‘ Babulon lalin Zedekia leh Ahaba meia a rawh ang khân ,  Lalpa chuan i chungah ti ve rawh se , ’ tiin chûng mite hming chuan ânchhia an inlawh ang .  
because they have worked folly in Israel ,  and have committed adultery with their neighbors '  wives ,  and have spoken words in my name falsely ,  which I didn ' t command them ;  and I am he who knows ,  and am witness ,  says Yahweh . 	Israel ramah â takin thil an ti a ,  an ṭhenawmte nupui an uiresak a ,  ka hmingin dawt an sawi a ,  an hnênah thu ka pe si lo .  Kei hi hrechiangtu thuhretu ka ni , ’ Lalpa thuchhuak chuan a ti , ” tiin .  
Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak ,  saying , 	Nehelam mi ,  Semaia hnênah heti hian thu sawi rawh :  
Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies ,  the God of Israel ,  saying ,  Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem ,  and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah ,  the priest ,  and to all the priests ,  saying , 	  “  Israel - te Pathian ,  Engkim Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti ,  Jerusalem mipui hnênah te ,  Maaseia fapa Zefania ,  puithiam hnênah te ,  puithiam dang hnênah te nangma hmingin lehkha i thawn a ,  hetiangin i ti a :  
Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest ,  that there may be officers in the house of Yahweh ,  for every man who is mad ,  and makes himself a prophet ,  that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles . 	 ‘ Nang Zefania ,  Lalpa chuan puithiam Jehoiada aiawhtu atân a ruat che a ,  Lalpa ina â taka thu puang ṭhînte chu kawl te ,  thîrkawl te buntîrtu atân ruat i ni a . 
Now therefore ,  why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth ,  who makes himself a prophet to you , 	Tûnah ,  Jeremia ,  Anathot khaw mi ,  in hnêna thu puangtu hi engtizia nge i zilh loh  ?  
because he has sent to us in Babylon ,  saying ,   [ The captivity ]  is long :  build houses ,  and dwell in them ;  and plant gardens ,  and eat the fruit of them  ?  	Babulon - a awmte chu ,   ‘ Saltân chhûng a rei dâwn a ,  in leh lote bêngbel ula ,  huante pawh siam ula ,  in thlaite ei rawh u , ’ tiin thu a thawn hi , ” tiin .  
Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet . 	Puithiam Zefania chuan he lehkha hi zâwlnei Jeremia hriatah a chhiar a .  
Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah ,  saying , 	Lalpa thu chu Jeremia hnênah hetiangin a lo thleng a :  
Send to all them of the captivity ,  saying ,  Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite :  Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you ,  and I didn ' t send him ,  and he has caused you to trust in a lie ; 	  “  Hêng hi saltâng hrilh rawh :  Lalpa chuan Nehelam mi Zefania chungchâng heti hian a sawi :  Semaia hian in hnênah thu a hril a ,  ani chu ka tirh a ni lo ,  dâwt a rintîr che u a ni .  
therefore thus says Yahweh ,  Behold ,  I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite ,  and his seed ;  he shall not have a man to dwell among this people ,  neither shall he see the good that I will do to my people ,  says Yahweh ,  because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh . 	Chuvângin ,  Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :  Nehelam mi Semaia leh a thlahte chu ka hrem dâwn .  In zîngah thlah pakhat mah a nei lo vang a ,  ka mite tâna thil ṭha ka tih tûr pawh a chang ve hek lo vang ,  Lalpa laka hel thu a puan avângin ,  tih hi Lalpa thuchhuak a ni , ” a ti a . 
After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people ,  he entered into Capernaum . 	Mite hriat atâna a duh ang a sawi zawh chuan Kapernaumah a lût ta a . 
A certain centurion ' s servant ,  who was dear to him ,  was sick and at the point of death . 	Sipai za hotu pakhat bawih duh tak a dam lo va ,  a thi lek lek a . 
When he heard about Jesus ,  he sent to him elders of the Jews ,  asking him to come and save his servant . 	Isua chanchin a lo hriat chuan a bawih tidam tûra ngên tûrin Juda upate a tîr a . 
When they came to Jesus ,  they begged him earnestly ,  saying ,   " He is worthy for you to do this for him , 	Anni chuan Isua hnên an va thleng a ,  ṭhahnemngai takin an ngên a ,    “  Hei hi i tihsak tlâk a ni e , 
for he loves our nation ,  and he built our synagogue for us .  " 	kan hnam hi a hmangaih a ,  sunagog pawh min saksak a ni , ” an ti a . 
Jesus went with them .  When he was now not far from the house ,  the centurion sent friends to him ,  saying to him ,   " Lord ,  don ' t trouble yourself ,  for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof . 	Tichuan ,  Isua chu an rualin a kal ve ta a .  In a thlen dâwn chuan sipai za hotu chuan a ṭhiante a tîr a ,    “  Lalpa ,  lo kal harsa duh suh , 
Therefore I didn ' t even think myself worthy to come to you ;  but say the word ,  and my servant will be healed . 	ka in chhûng i luhna tlâk a ni lo va ,  i hnêna lo kal tlâkah pawh ka inngai lo va ni ;  thu pe la ,  ka nau chu a dam mai ang . 
For I also am a man placed under authority ,  having under myself soldiers .  I tell this one ,   ' Go !  '  and he goes ;  and to another ,   ' Come !  '  and he comes ;  and to my servant ,   ' Do this ,  '  and he does it .  " 	Kei pawh mi thuhnuaia awm ka ni a ,  ka hnuaiah sipaite an awm leh chhâwng a ,   ‘ Kal rawh , ’ ka tiha chu a kal a ,   ‘ lo haw rawh , ’ ka tiha chu a lo haw mai a ,  ka bawih pawhin  ‘ hei hi ti rawh , ’ ka tih chu a ti mai ṭhîn , ” a ti a . 
When Jesus heard these things ,  he marveled at him ,  and turned and said to the multitude who followed him ,   " I tell you ,  I have not found such great faith ,  no ,  not in Israel .  " 	Tin ,  Isuan chu chu a hriatin chu mi chu mak a ti hle a ,  a lehhawi a ,  a zuitu mipui hnênah ,    “  Ka hrilh a che u ,  heti êma ring nasa hi Israel - te zîngah tu mah ka hmu lo , ” a ti a . 
Those who were sent ,  returning to the house ,  found that the servant who had been sick was well . 	Mi tirhte kha inah an va haw leh chuan bawih chu damin an va hmu a . 
It happened soon afterwards ,  that he went to a city called Nain .  Many of his disciples ,  along with a great multitude ,  went with him . 	A hnu lawkah khaw pakhat Nain an tihah chuan a kal a ,  a zirtîrte leh mipui nasa tak an kal ve a . 
Now when he drew near to the gate of the city ,  behold ,  one who was dead was carried out ,  the only son of his mother ,  and she was a widow .  Many people of the city were with her . 	Khaw kulh kawngka a thlen dâwn chuan ,  ngai teh ,  mitthi an rawn zâwn chhuak a ;  a nu chu hmeithai a ni a ,  a fapa mal a ni .  Khuaa mi tam tak pawh an lo kal ve a . 
When the Lord saw her ,  he had compassion on her ,  and said to her ,   " Don ' t cry .  " 	Lalpa chuan a han hmuhin chu nu chu a khawngaih ta êm êm a ,    “  Ṭap tawh suh , ” a ti a . 
He came near and touched the coffin ,  and the bearers stood still .  He said ,   " Young man ,  I tell you ,  arise !  " 	A va hnaih a ,  hlâng chu a chelh a ,  a zâwntute pawh chu an ding ta a ;    “  Tlangvâl ,  tho rawh ,  ka ti a che , ” a ti a . 
He who was dead sat up ,  and began to speak .  And he gave him to his mother . 	Mitthi chu a ṭhuchhuak a ,  a lo ṭawng ta a ,  a nu hnênah chuan a pe a . 
Fear took hold of all ,  and they glorified God ,  saying ,   " A great prophet has arisen among us !  "  and ,   " God has visited his people !  " 	Mi zawng zawngin an hlau ta a ,  Pathian an fak a ,    “  Kan zîngah zâwlnei ropui tak a lo awm ta a nih hi , ” an ti a ;    “  Pathianin a mite a rawn tlawh ta a nih hi , ” an ti bawk a . 
This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea ,  and in all the surrounding region . 	Chûng thu chu Judai ram zawng zawngah leh a kiang vêl ram tinah a thang chhuak ta a . 
The disciples of John told him about all these things . 	Chûng thu zawng zawng chu Johana zirtîrte chuan an pu chu an hrilh a . 
John ,  calling to himself two of his disciples ,  sent them to Jesus ,  saying ,   " Are you the one who is coming ,  or should we look for another  ?   " 	Johana chuan a zirtîr pahnih a ko va ,  Lalpa hnênah chuan a tîr a ,    “  Lo kal tûra chu i ni nge ,  mi dang kan la nghâk ang  ?  ” tiin . 
When the men had come to him ,  they said ,   " John the Baptizer has sent us to you ,  saying ,   ' Are you he who comes ,  or should we look for another  ?   '  " 	Chu mite chu Isua hnên an va thleng a ,    “  Baptistu Johanan ,   ‘ Lo kal tûra i ni nge mi dang kan la nghâk ang  ?  ’ tiin i hnênah min tîr a ni , ” an ti a . 
In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits ;  and to many who were blind he gave sight . 	Chutih lai tak chuan Isuan mi tam tak ,  natna tuar te ,  hripui vei te ,  thlarau bawlhhlawh paite a tidam a ,  mitdel tam tak pawh an mit a lo tihvârsak a . 
Jesus answered them ,   " Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard :  that the blind receive their sight ,  the lame walk ,  the lepers are cleansed ,  the deaf hear ,  the dead are raised up ,  and the poor have good news preached to them . 	Tichuan ,  anni chu a chhâng a ,    “  Kal leh ta ula ,  in thil hmuh leh in hriatte hi Johana chu va hrilh tawh u ;  mitdelte chu an mit a vâr a ,  kebaite kein an kal a ,  phârte an thianghlim a ,  bengngawngte pawh an beng a vâr a ,  mitthite kaihthawh an ni ta a ,  pachhiate hnênah Chanchin Ṭha hrilh a ni ta . 
Blessed is he who is not offended by me .  " 	Tu pawh ka laka beidawng lo chu an nihlawh e , ” a ti a . 
When John ' s messengers had departed ,  he began to tell the multitudes about John ,   " What did you go out into the wilderness to see  ?   A reed shaken by the wind  ?  	Johana mi tirhte an haw hnu chuan mipui hnênah Johana chungchâng a sawi ta a .    “  Eng ennawm en tûrin nge thlalêrah in kal  ?   Thli chhêm nghîn luang maw  ?  
But what did you go out to see  ?   A man clothed in soft clothing  ?   Behold ,  those who are gorgeously dressed ,  and live delicately ,  are in kings '  courts . 	A nih leh tu en tûrin nge in kal  ?   Puan nêm sina inchei maw  ?   Puan nêm sin leh mi neinungte chu lal inah asin an awm . 
But what did you go out to see  ?   A prophet  ?   Yes ,  I tell you ,  and much more than a prophet . 	Eng ber en tûrin nge in kal  ?   Zâwlnei en tûrin maw  ?   A nih ngei kha ;  ka hrilh a che u ,  ani chu zâwlnei ai pawha ropui zâwk a ni .  He mi hi alâwm : 
This is he of whom it is written ,   ' Behold ,  I send my messenger before your face ,  who will prepare your way before you .  ' 	 ‘ Ngai teh ,  ka tirhkoh i hmaah ka tîr a ,  Ani chuan i hmaah i kawng a buatsaih ang , ’ tia a chanchin an ziak kha . 
 " For I tell you ,  among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer ,  yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he .  " 	Ka hrilh a che u ,  hmeichhe hrin zîngah Johana aia ropui zâwk an awm lo ;  amaherawhchu ,  Pathian rama mi tê ber pawh ani ai chuan a ropui zâwk , ” a ti a . 
When all the people and the tax collectors heard this ,  they declared God to be just ,  having been baptized with John ' s baptism . 	Vântlângho leh chhiahkhawntute chuan Johana thu an hriatin Pathian thiltih dik tak chu pawmin a baptisma an chang hlawm a ; 
But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God ,  not being baptized by him themselves . 	Farisai - te leh Dân hremite erawh chuan baptisma chu an chang ve duh lo ,  anmahni tâna Pathian remruat chu an duh lo a ni . 
 " To what then will I liken the people of this generation  ?   What are they like  ?  	Isuan ,    “  Tûnlai mite hi eng nên nge ka tehkhin ang  ?   Eng ang nge an nih  ?   Naupang dâwrpui hmuna ṭhu - a ,  inau tawna , 
They are like children who sit in the marketplace ,  and call one to another ,  saying ,   ' We piped to you ,  and you didn ' t dance .  We mourned ,  and you didn ' t weep .  ' 	 ‘ Phênglâwng kan tumsak che u a ,  in lâm lo va ,  kan ṭap vak a ,  in ṭap chuang bawk si lo , ’ intite ang hi an ni . 
For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ,  and you say ,   ' He has a demon .  ' 	Baptistu Johana chu a lo kal a ,  chhang a ei lo va ,  uain a in hek lo va ,  nangnin  ‘ ramhuai a zâwl a nih hi , ’ in ti a . 
The Son of Man has come eating and drinking ,  and you say ,   ' Behold ,  a gluttonous man ,  and a drunkard ;  a friend of tax collectors and sinners !  ' 	Mihring Fapa a lo kal a ,  a eiin a in a ,  nangnin ,   ‘ En teh u ,  mi vir ,  uain heh mi ,  chhiahkhawntute leh mi sualte ṭhian saw , ’ in ti leh si a . 
Wisdom is justified by all her children .  " 	Nimahsela ,  Pathian finna dikzia chu a pawmtuteah a lang chhuak a ni , ” a ti a . 
One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him .  He entered into the Pharisee ' s house ,  and sat at the table . 	Farisai zînga pakhatin chaw eiah a sâwm a ,  Farisai inah chuan a lût a ,  chaw a kîl a . 
Behold ,  a woman in the city who was a sinner ,  when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee ' s house ,  she brought an alabaster jar of ointment . 	Ngai teh ,  chumi khuaa hmeichhe sual pakhatin Farisai inah chaw a ei tih a hriat chuan alabasta bûrin hriak rimtui a rawn keng a . 
Standing behind at his feet weeping ,  she began to wet his feet with her tears ,  and she wiped them with the hair of her head ,  kissed his feet ,  and anointed them with the ointment . 	A hnungah ,  a ke bulah chuan ṭap chungin a ding a ;  a mittui chuan a ke chu a far huh a ,  a sam chuan a zu hru a ,  a ke chu a fâwp ta ngawih ngawih a ,  hriak rimtui chu a leih a . 
Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it ,  he said to himself ,   " This man ,  if he were a prophet ,  would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him ,  that she is a sinner .  " 	A sâwmtu Farisai chuan a hmuhin ,    “  He mi hi zâwlnei ni tak tak se chu a dektu hmeichhia hi tu nge a niha ,  eng ang mi sual nge a nih hi a hre tûr , ” a ti rilru a . 
Jesus answered him ,   " Simon ,  I have something to tell you .  "  He said ,   " Teacher ,  say on .  " 	Isuan a hnênah ,    “  Simon ,  i hnênah thu kam khat sawi tûr ka nei , ” a ti a .  Ani chuan ,    “  Sawi ta che ,  Zirtîrtu , ” a ti a . 
 " A certain lender had two debtors .  The one owed five hundred denarii ,  and the other fifty . 	Isuan ,    “  Mi pahnihin tangka pûktîrtu hnênah lei an ba a ,  pakhat chuan duli zanga ,  pakhat chuan duli sawmnga .  Rulhna an neih loh avângin a ngaidam ve ve ta a . 
When they couldn ' t pay ,  he forgave them both .  Which of them therefore will love him most  ?   " 	Chutichuan ,  tu zâwk chuan nge ani chu hmangaih zâwk ang  ?  ” a ti a . 
Simon answered ,   " He ,  I suppose ,  to whom he forgave the most .  "  He said to him ,   " You have judged correctly .  " 	Simona chuan ,    “  A ngaihdam tam zâwk chuan a ni ang chu , ” a ti a .  Ani chuan ,    “  I ti dik e , ” a ti a . 
Turning to the woman ,  he said to Simon ,   " Do you see this woman  ?   I entered into your house ,  and you gave me no water for my feet ,  but she has wet my feet with her tears ,  and wiped them with the hair of her head . 	Hmeichhe lam chu a hawi a ,  Simona hnênah ,    “  He hmeichhia hi i hmu êm  ?   I inah ka lo lût a ,  nangin ka ke silna tûr tui mi pe lo va ,  ani hi chuan a mittuiin ka ke a tihuh a ,  a samin a hru a . 
You gave me no kiss ,  but she ,  since the time I came in ,  has not ceased to kiss my feet . 	Nangin mi lo fâwp lo va ,  ani hi chuan a lo luh tirh ata ka ke fawh a bâng lo . 
You didn ' t anoint my head with oil ,  but she has anointed my feet with ointment . 	Nangin ka luah hriak mi thih lo va ,  ani erawh hi chuan hriak rimtui a leih a ni . 
Therefore I tell you ,  her sins ,  which are many ,  are forgiven ,  for she loved much .  But to whom little is forgiven ,  the same loves little .  " 	Chuvângin ,  ka hrilh a che ,  a sual zawng zawng chu ngaihdam a ni ta ,  ani pawhin heti tak hian a hmangaih a ni .  Ngaihdamsak nêp chuan a hmangaih nêp ṭhîn , ” a ti a . 
He said to her ,   " Your sins are forgiven .  " 	Hmeichhe hnênah chuan ,    “  I sualte ngaihdam a ni ta , ” a ti a . 
Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves ,   " Who is this who even forgives sins  ?   " 	A chaw kîlpuite chuan ,    “  Sualte pawh ngaidam ta mai chu tu nge maw a nih le  ?  ” an inti a . 
He said to the woman ,   " Your faith has saved you .  Go in peace .  " 	Tin ,  anin hmeichhe hnênah chuan ,    “  I rinna hian a chhandam che a ni ,  thlamuang takin kal rawh , ” a ti a . 
He called the twelve together ,  and gave them power and authority over all demons ,  and to cure diseases . 	Sâwmpahnihte chu a ko khâwm a ,  ramhuai tin rêng chunga thiltihtheihna leh thuneihna a pe a ,  nâte tihdam theihna pawh a pe bawk a ;  
He sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God ,  and to heal the sick . 	Pathian ram thu hril tûr leh damlote tidam tûrin a tîr chhuak ta a .  
He said to them ,   " Take nothing for your journey -  - neither staffs ,  nor wallet ,  nor bread ,  nor money ;  neither have two coats apiece . 	An hnênah chuan ,    “  Zin kawng atân tiang te ,  iptê te ,  chhang te ,  tangka te eng mah keng suh u ;  kawr pahnih pawh keng suh u .  
Into whatever house you enter ,  stay there ,  and depart from there . 	In kalna apiangah in thlen in ngaiah thleng reng ula ,  chuta ṭang ngei chuan chhuak leh ang che u .  
As many as don ' t receive you ,  when you depart from that city ,  shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them .  " 	Nangni lo ngaihsak lo che u khua chu ,  in chhuahsan hunah an tihdik lohzia hriattîr nân in kephaha vaivut chu thing thla ang che u , ” a ti a .  
They departed ,  and went throughout the villages ,  preaching the Good News ,  and healing everywhere . 	Tichuan ,  an chhuak ta a ,  khaw tin an fang a ,  hmun tinah Chanchin Ṭha hrilin mite an tidam zêl a . 
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him ;  and he was very perplexed ,  because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead , 	Lal Heroda chuan chûng thil chu a lo hre ve a .  Ṭhenkhatin ,    “  Johana kha mitthi zîng ata a tho leh ta a ni , ” te an ti a ;  
and by some that Elijah had appeared ,  and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again . 	a ṭhenin ,    “  Elija a lo inlâr ta a ni , ” te an ti a ;  a ṭhenin ,    “  Hmânlai zâwlnei tu emaw kha a lo tho leh ta a ni , ” te an tih avâng chuan a ngaihna a hre lo va . 
Herod said ,   " John I beheaded ,  but who is this ,  about whom I hear such things  ?   "  He sought to see him . 	Heroda chuan ,    “  Johana chu a lu ka tansak tawh kha !  A chanchin heti kauva nasa ka hriat hi tu nge ni ta  ?  ” a ti a ,  amah chu hmuh a tum ta a .  
The apostles ,  when they had returned ,  told him what things they had done .  He took them ,  and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida . 	Tirhkohte kha an lo haw a ,  a hnênah an thiltihte an rawn sawi a .  Anni chu a hruai a ,  Bethsaida an tih khuaah chuan a kal hranpui ta a .  
But the multitudes ,  perceiving it ,  followed him .  He welcomed them ,  and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God ,  and he cured those who needed healing . 	Nimahsela ,  mipuiho chuan an hriatin an zui ve ta a .  Anni chu a lo lâwm a ,  Pathian ram thu a lo hrilh a ,  tihdam ngai apiang a tidam a .  
The day began to wear away ;  and the twelve came ,  and said to him ,   " Send the multitude away ,  that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms ,  and lodge ,  and get food ,  for we are here in a deserted place .  " 	Ni a tlâk dâwn lai chuan Sâwmpahnihte chu an lo kal a ,    “  Mipuiho hi kan kiang vêl khuaahte leh lovahte thlen in leh ei tûr zawngin kaltîr ta che ,  hmun thlalêra awm kan nih hi , ” an ti a .  
But he said to them ,   " You give them something to eat .  "  They said ,   " We have no more than five loaves and two fish ,  unless we should go and buy food for all these people .  " 	Ani erawh chuan ,    “  Nangmahnin ei tûr pe rawh u , ” a ti a .  Anni chuan ,    “  Chhang panga leh sangha pahnih bak kan nei hlei nêm  -   hêng mi ei tûr kan va lei ngawt loh chuan , ” an ti a .  Patling ngawt pawh sângnga lai an ni si a .  
For they were about five thousand men .  He said to his disciples ,   " Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each .  " 	Ani chuan zirtîrte hnênah ,    “  A pâwl pâwlin ṭhuttîr rawh u ,  sawmnga vêl zêlin , ” a ti a .  
They did so ,  and made them all sit down . 	Chutiang chuan an ti a ,  an ṭhuttîr ta vek a .  
He took the five loaves and the two fish ,  and looking up to the sky ,  he blessed them ,  and broke them ,  and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude . 	Chhang panga leh sangha pahnih chu a la a ,  vân lam enin malsâwmna a sawi a ,  a phel a ,  mipui hnêna sem tûrin zirtîrte chu a pe a .  
They ate ,  and were all filled .  They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over . 	An zavai chuan an ei a ,  an tlai ta ṭheuh va ;  an sem bâng chu an la khâwm a ,  bâwm sâwm leh pahnih khat a la ni . 
It happened ,  as he was praying alone ,  that the disciples were with him ,  and he asked them ,   " Who do the multitudes say that I am  ?   " 	Vawi khat chu fianriala a ṭawngṭai laiin a zirtîrte pawh an awm ve a ,  an hnênah ,    “  Mipuiten tu nge nia min sawi  ?  ” tiin a zâwt a .  
They answered ,   "  ' John the Baptizer ,  '  but others say ,   ' Elijah ,  '  and others ,  that one of the old prophets is risen again .  " 	Anni chuan ,    “    ‘ Baptistu Johana , ’ ti che an awm a ,  a ṭhenin  ‘ Elija , ’ an ti che a ,  ṭhenkhat erawh chuan  ‘ hmânlai zâwlneite zînga tu emaw tholeh ta , ’ ni âwmin an sawi che , ” tiin an chhâng a .  
He said to them ,   " But who do you say that I am  ?   "  Peter answered ,   " The Christ of God .  " 	Ani chuan ,    “  A nih ,  nangnin tu nge nia mi hriat  ?  ” a ti a .  Petera chuan ,    “  Pathian Krista chu , ” tiin a chhâng a . 
But he warned them ,  and commanded them to tell this to no one , 	Tichuan ,  tu mah hrilh lo tûrin thu a pe tlat a .  
saying ,   " The Son of Man must suffer many things ,  and be rejected by the elders ,  chief priests ,  and scribes ,  and be killed ,  and the third day be raised up .  " 	  “  Mihring Fapa hian thil tam tak a tuar tûr a ni ;  upate ,  puithiam lalte ,  Dân zirtîrtuten an hnâwl ang a ,  an tihlum dâwn a ;  amaherawhchu ,  ni thum chinah kaihthawh a ni ngei dâwn , ” a ti a .  
He said to all ,   " If anyone desires to come after me ,  let him deny himself ,  take up his cross ,  and follow me . 	Tin ,  mi hnênah ,    “  Tu pawh mi zui duh chuan mahni inngaihtuah chang lovin ,  ni tin mahni kraws puin mi zui rawh se .  
For whoever desires to save his life will lose it ,  but whoever will lose his life for my sake ,  the same will save it . 	Tu pawh mahni nun humhim tum chuan an chân ang a ,  tu pawh keimah avânga nun chân chuan an humhim ang .  
For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world ,  and loses or forfeits his own self  ?  	Miin khawvêl hi a pumin nei sela ,  amah chuan chhiat phahin ,  boral phah si sela ,  a tân eng nge sâwt ang  ?   
For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words ,  of him will the Son of Man be ashamed ,  when he comes in his glory ,  and the glory of the Father ,  and of the holy angels . 	Ka thu leh kei mi zahpui apiang chu ,  Mihring Fapa pawhin a ropuina nên ,  Pa leh vântîrhkoh thianghlimte ropuina nêna a lo kal hunah anni chu a la rawn zahpui ve ang .  
But I tell you the truth :  There are some of those who stand here ,  who will in no way taste of death ,  until they see the Kingdom of God .  " 	Dik takin ka hrilh a che u ,  heta dingho ṭhenkhat hi ,  Pathian ram an hmuh hma chu thi lo tûr an awm , ” a ti a . 
It happened about eight days after these sayings ,  that he took with him Peter ,  John ,  and James ,  and went up onto the mountain to pray . 	Chûng thu a sawi aṭanga ni riat lai hnuah chuan ,  Petera te ,  Johana te ,  Jakoba te hruaiin ,  ṭawngṭai tûrin tlângah a chho va .  
As he was praying ,  the appearance of his face was altered ,  and his clothing became white and dazzling . 	Chutia a ṭawngṭai lai chuan a hmêl lan dân chu a lo danglam ta a ,  a puante chu a vâr ta sur mai a .  
Behold ,  two men were talking with him ,  who were Moses and Elijah , 	Ngai teh ,  mi pahnihin an rawn kâwm a ,  chûng mite chu Mosia leh Elija an ni ;  
who appeared in glory ,  and spoke of his departure ,  which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem . 	ropui takin an rawn inlâr a ,  Jerusalem - a a thih tleitlâkna tûr chungchâng an sawi a ni .  
Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep ,  but when they were fully awake ,  they saw his glory ,  and the two men who stood with him . 	Petera leh a ṭhiante chu an mut a chhuak hle a ,  an han harh chian chuan a ropuina leh a bula mi pahnih dingte chu an hmu a .  
It happened ,  as they were parting from him ,  that Peter said to Jesus ,   " Master ,  it is good for us to be here .  Let ' s make three tents :  one for you ,  and one for Moses ,  and one for Elijah ,  "  not knowing what he said . 	Tin ,  Isua an ṭhen dâwn lai chuan Peteran ,    “  Hotupa ,  heta kan awm hi a ṭha e ,  bâwkte pathum kan khawh ang e ,  i tân pakhat ,  Mosia tân pakhat ,  Elija tân pakhat , ” a ti a ,  eng nge a sawi pawh a hre mumal lo va ni .  
While he said these things ,  a cloud came and overshadowed them ,  and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud . 	Chûng thu chu a sawi lai mêkin chhûm a lo zîng a ,  anniho chu a rawn khuh a ,  chhûmin a rawn chîm chuan an hlau hle a .  Chhûm aṭang chuan aw a lo chhuak a , 
A voice came out of the cloud ,  saying ,   " This is my beloved Son .  Listen to him !  " 	  “  Hei hi ka mi thlan ,  ka Fapa chu a ni ;  ama thu hi ngai rawh u , ” tiin .  
When the voice came ,  Jesus was found alone .  They were silent ,  and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen . 	Aw a reh hnu chuan Isua chauh chu an hmu a .  Chûng lai chuan an thil hmuh chu an ngawihpui tlat a ,  tu mah eng mah an hrilh lo . 
It happened on the next day ,  when they had come down from the mountain ,  that a great multitude met him . 	A tûka tlâng ata an chhuk chu mipui nasa takin an lo hmuak a .  
Behold ,  a man from the crowd called out ,  saying ,   " Teacher ,  I beg you to look at my son ,  for he is my only child . 	Mipui zînga pa pakhat chu a au chhuak a ,    “  Zirtîrtu ,  ka fapa ,  ka fa neih chhun chu ,  en tûrin ka ngên a che ; 
Behold ,  a spirit takes him ,  he suddenly cries out ,  and it convulses him so that he foams ,  and it hardly departs from him ,  bruising him severely . 	thlarauvin a man fo mai a ,  a khawih ṭê tuar tuar ṭhîn a ,  chilphuan tla bawrh bawrhin a sawisa a ,  thi ang dêrin a kalsan ṭhîn .  
I begged your disciples to cast it out ,  and they couldn ' t .  " 	I zirtîrte hi hnawt chhuak tûra ka ngên lahin an thei si lo , ” a ti a .  
Jesus answered ,   " Faithless and perverse generation ,  how long shall I be with you and bear with you  ?   Bring your son here .  " 	Isuan a chhâng a ,    “  Tûnlai mi ,  rinna tlachham leh tihmawhte u ,  eng chen nge in hnênah ka awm anga ,  ka dawh theih dâwn che u  ?   I fapa chu han hruai teh , ” a ti a .  
While he was still coming ,  the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently .  But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit ,  and healed the boy ,  and gave him back to his father . 	A rawn hruai laiin ramhuai chuan a ṭhuai thlu a ,  a sawisa nek a .  Nimahsela ,  Isuan thlarau bawlhhlawh chu a hau va ,  naupang chu a tidam a ,  a pa hnênah chuan a pe ta a .  
They were all astonished at the majesty of God .  But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did ,  he said to his disciples , 	Mi chuan Pathian ropuizia chu mak an ti a . 
 " Let these words sink into your ears ,  for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men .  " 	Mi zawng zawngin a thil tihte mak tia an ngaihsân lai chuan a zirtîrte hnênah ,    “  Hêng thu hi nangni bengah chuan châm reng rawh se .  Mihring Fapa hi mihringte kuta mantîr a ni dâwn si a , ” a ti a .  Nimahsela ,  a thu sawi chu a ngaihna an hre lo .  
But they didn ' t understand this saying .  It was concealed from them ,  that they should not perceive it ,  and they were afraid to ask him about this saying . 	An hriatthiam theih loh nân an lakah thup a ni ;  chu thu chu amah lah an zâwt fiah ngam bawk si lo . 
There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest . 	An zîngah tu nge ropui ber ang tih thu - ah an lo inhnial a .  
Jesus ,  perceiving the reasoning of their hearts ,  took a little child ,  and set him by his side , 	Isuan an thil ngaihtuah chu a hria a ,  naupang tê hi a kai a ,  a bulah a dintîr a ,  
and said to them ,   " Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me .  Whoever receives me receives him who sent me .  For whoever is least among you all ,  this one will be great .  " 	an hnênah ,    “  Tu pawh he naupang hi ka hming avânga lâwm chu kei mi lâwm a ni ;  kei mi lâwm chu mi tîrtu lâwm a ni ;  in zînga tê ber hi a ni ropui ber , ” a ti a .  
John answered ,   " Master ,  we saw someone casting out demons in your name ,  and we forbade him ,  because he doesn ' t follow with us .  " 	Tin ,  Johana chuan ani chu a bia a ,    “  Hotupa ,  mi pakhat i hminga ramhuaite hnawt chhuak kan hmu a ,  keini anga a zui ve loh che avângin khap kan lo tum asin , ” a ti a .  
Jesus said to him ,   " Don ' t forbid him ,  for he who is not against us is for us .  " 	Isuan a hnênah ,    “  Khap suh u .  Tu pawh dodâl lo che u chu in lamṭang an ni ngai e , ” a ti a .  
It came to pass ,  when the days were near that he should be taken up ,  he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem , 	Amah hruai chhoh hun a lo hnaih chuan Jerusalem - a kal a tum lui tlat a .  
and sent messengers before his face .  They went ,  and entered into a village of the Samaritans ,  so as to prepare for him . 	A hmaah lamkal a tlântîr a .  Anni chu an kal a ,  a tân engkim lo buatsaih fel tûrin Samari mite khaw pakhatah an lût a ;  
They didn ' t receive him ,  because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem . 	mahse ,  Jerusalem pana kal zêl a tum tlat avângin an lo ngaihsak lo va . 
When his disciples ,  James and John ,  saw this ,  they said ,   " Lord ,  do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky ,  and destroy them ,  just as Elijah did  ?   " 	Tichuan ,  a zirtîr Jakoba leh Johana chuan an han hmuh ve chuan ,    “  Lalpa ,  hêngho kan hlum vek nân hian vân ata mei ko thla ila i duh em  ?  ” an ti a .  
But he turned and rebuked them ,   " You don ' t know of what kind of spirit you are . 	Ani erawh chu a han lehhawi a ,  a kamkhat a ;  
For the Son of Man didn ' t come to destroy men ' s lives ,  but to save them .  "  They went to another village . 	khaw dangah an kal ta a . 
As they went on the way ,  a certain man said to him ,   " I want to follow you wherever you go ,  Lord .  " 	Kalkawnga an kal laiin mi pakhatin a hnênah ,    “  I kalna apiangah ka zui ang che , ” a rawn ti a .  
Jesus said to him ,   " The foxes have holes ,  and the birds of the sky have nests ,  but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head .  " 	Isuan ,    “  Sihalten kua an nei a ,  chunglêng savate pawhin riahhmun an nei ;  Mihring Fapa erawh hi chuan lu nghahna hmun tûr a nei lo , ” a ti a .  
He said to another ,   " Follow me !  "  But he said ,   " Lord ,  allow me first to go and bury my father .  " 	Mi dang hnênah ,    “  Mi zui rawh , ” a ti ve thung a .  Ani chuan ,    “  Lalpa ,  ka pa ka va vui ta zet ang e aw  ?  ” a ti a .  
But Jesus said to him ,   " Leave the dead to bury their own dead ,  but you go and announce the Kingdom of God .  " 	Isua erawh chuan ,    “  Mitthiin anmahni mitthi chu lo vui mai rawh se ;  nang erawh chuan Pathian ram thu hi va hril darh zâwk rawh , ” a ti a .  
Another also said ,   " I want to follow you ,  Lord ,  but first allow me to say good - bye to those who are at my house .  " 	Mi dangin ,    “  Lalpa ,  ka zui ang che ,  amaherawhchu ,  in lama mite ka va chibai zet ang e , ” a ti a .  
But Jesus said to him ,   " No one ,  having put his hand to the plow ,  and looking back ,  is fit for the Kingdom of God .  " 	Chu mi hnênah chuan Isuan ,    “  Leilehnaa kut nghat reng chunga hnung lam hawi bawk si chu tu mah Pathian ram mi ni tlâk an awm lo ve , ” a ti a . 
 " As for me ,  in the first year of Darius the Mede ,  I stood up to confirm and strengthen him . 	  “  Media mi Daria a lal kum khat kum khân kei hi ka inrawlh ve a ,  ka tichak ta a ni , ” a ti a .  
Now will I show you the truth .  Behold ,  there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia ;  and the fourth shall be far richer than they all :  and when he has grown strong through his riches ,  he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece . 	  “  Tûnah thu dik ka hrilh dâwn che hi .  Persia ramah mi pathum indawtin an lo lal ang a ,  a palina chu a hausa fâl bîk ang ;  a hausak avânga a chak viau tâk hnu chuan Grik ram chu a cho vang .  
A mighty king shall stand up ,  who shall rule with great dominion ,  and do according to his will . 	Chu ramah chuan lal huai tak a lo lal ang a ,  ram zau tak a nei ang ,  a duh duhin a che vêl ang .  
When he shall stand up ,  his kingdom shall be broken ,  and shall be divided toward the four winds of the sky ,  but not to his posterity ,  nor according to his dominion with which he ruled ;  for his kingdom shall be plucked up ,  even for others besides these .

The king of the south shall be strong ,  and  [ one ]  of his princes ;  and he shall be strong above him ,  and have dominion ;  his dominion shall be a great dominion . 	  “  Chhim lam ram ,  Aigupta lal chu a chak hle ang a ;  mahse ,  lal pakhat dang kha a chak zâwk ang ,  a ram pawh a zau zâwk ang .  
At the end of years they shall join themselves together ;  and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement :  but she shall not retain the strength of her arm ;  neither shall he stand ,  nor his arm ;  but she shall be given up ,  and those who brought her ,  and he who became the father of her ,  and he who strengthened her in those times .

But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place ,  who shall come to the army ,  and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north ,  and shall deal against them ,  and shall prevail .

Also their gods ,  with their molten images ,   [ and ]  with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold ,  shall he carry captive into Egypt ;  and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north .

He shall come into the realm of the king of the south ,  but he shall return into his own land . 	Suria lal chuan Aigupta ram chu rûn a tum ang a ;  mahse ,  an lo hnawt kîr ang .  
His sons shall war ,  and shall assemble a multitude of great forces ,  which shall come on ,  and overflow ,  and pass through ;  and they shall return and war ,  even to his fortress . 	  “  Suria lal fapa chuan Aigupta chu rûn tûrin sipai a la ṭeuh vang a ;  tui lian ang maiin an lian ang a ,  an kulh pakhat chu an hualsak ang .  
The king of the south shall be moved with anger ,  and shall come forth and fight with him ,  even with the king of the north ;  and he shall set forth a great multitude ,  and the multitude shall be given into his hand . 	Aigupta lal thin chu a rim ang a ,  Suria ram lal chu a bei lêt ang a ,  a sipaite chu a mansak ṭeuh vang .  
The multitude shall be lifted up ,  and his heart shall be exalted ;  and he shall cast down tens of thousands ,  but he shall not prevail . 	A chak zâwk avâng leh sipai tam tak a thahsak avângin a inchhuang ta hle a ;  mahse ,  a chak zâwk reng dâwn lo .  
The king of the north shall return ,  and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former ;  and he shall come on at the end of the times ,   [ even of ]  years ,  with a great army and with much substance . 	  “  Suria lal chuan a hma aia tam sipai a la leh ṭeuh vang a ,  hun remchângah sipai tam tak leh râlthuam tam deuh nên a thawk leh ang .  
In those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south :  also the children of the violent among your people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision ;  but they shall fall . 	Aigupta ram lal lakah mi tam tak an hel ang ,  inlârna an hmuh tihhlawhtlin tumin i mite zînga mi kawlhsen ṭhenkhat pawh an hel ang a ;  mahse ,  an tlâwm mai ang .  
So the king of the north shall come ,  and cast up a mound ,  and take a well - fortified city :  and the forces of the south shall not stand ,  neither his chosen people ,  neither shall there be any strength to stand .

But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will ,  and none shall stand before him ;  and he shall stand in the glorious land ,  and in his hand shall be destruction .

He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom ,  and with him equitable conditions ;  and he shall perform them :  and he shall give him the daughter of women ,  to corrupt her ;  but she shall not stand ,  neither be for him . 	  “  Suria lal chuan a sipai rualte nên ram dang rûn a tum rilru leh a .

After this shall he turn his face to the islands ,  and shall take many :  but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ;  yes ,  moreover ,  he shall cause his reproach to turn on him .

Then shall stand up in his place one who shall cause a tax collector to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory ;  but within few days he shall be destroyed ,  neither in anger ,  nor in battle . 	  “  Chu lal aiah chuan mi pakhat a lo lal ang a ,  chu mi chuan a ram a lo hausak theih nân chhiah chawi luihtîr tûrin hotute a tîr chhuak ang a .

In his place shall stand up a contemptible person ,  to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom :  but he shall come in time of security ,  and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries . 	  “  A aiah mi sual deuh pakhat a lo lal dâwn ,  dân anga lallukhum khumtîr pawh a ni lo vang ;  fin vervêk thawhin a lo lal thut mai dâwn a ni .

After the treaty made with him he shall work deceitfully ;  for he shall come up ,  and shall become strong ,  with a small people . 	Inṭhianna thu thlunpuiin hnam dangte chu a bum ang a ,  ram zîm têa lal ni mah se a chak ang . 
In time of security shall he come even on the fattest places of the province ;  and he shall do that which his fathers have not done ,  nor his fathers '  fathers ;  he shall scatter among them prey ,  and spoil ,  and substance :  yes ,  he shall devise his devices against the strongholds ,  even for a time .

He shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army ;  and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army ;  but he shall not stand ;  for they shall devise devices against him . 	  “  Aigupta ram lal bei tûrin a insiam chak a ,  huai takin sipai tam tak a hruai a ;  mahse ,  ani chuan sipai tam zet chak tak nên a lo bei lêt ang ;  amaherawhchu ,  an phiarrûkna avângin Aigupta lal chuan a ngam lo vang .  
Yes ,  they who eat of his dainties shall destroy him ,  and his army shall overflow ;  and many shall fall down slain . 	Ama mi ,  a chawhlui kîlpui ṭhinte ngei chu amah tichhetu an ni ang ;  a sipai tam tak chu an thi bawk ang a ,  an darh zo vang .  
As for both these kings ,  their hearts shall be to do mischief ,  and they shall speak lies at one table :  but it shall not prosper ;  for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .

Then shall he return into his land with great substance ;  and his heart  [ shall be ]  against the holy covenant ;  and he shall do  [ his pleasure ]  ,  and return to his own land .

At the time appointed he shall return ,  and come into the south ;  but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former . 	  “  Chumi hnu deuhvah Aigupta ram a rûn leh ang a ;  mahse ,  tûn hma ang kha a ni tawh lo vang .  
For ships of Kittim shall come against him ;  therefore he shall be grieved ,  and shall return ,  and have indignation against the holy covenant ,  and shall do  [ his pleasure ]  :  he shall even return ,  and have regard to those who forsake the holy covenant . 	Amah bei tûrin Kitim - ho lawng rual a lo kal ang a ,  a hlau hle ang .

Forces shall stand on his part ,  and they shall profane the sanctuary ,  even the fortress ,  and shall take away the continual  [ burnt offering ]  ,  and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate .

Such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries ;  but the people who know their God shall be strong ,  and do  [ exploits ]  . 	Thuthlung thianghlim bânsantute chu fak derin lamṭangah a siam ang a ;  mahse ,  Pathian thu zâwmtute chu an ṭang tlat ang a ,  an bei lêt ang .  
Those who are wise among the people shall instruct many ;  yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame ,  by captivity and by spoil ,   [ many ]  days . 	An zînga hruaitu fingte chuan mi dang pawh an hrilh fing ang a ,  hun eng emaw ti chhûng chu a ṭhen salah an man ang a ,  an rawk bawk ang .  
Now when they shall fall ,  they shall be helped with a little help ;  but many shall join themselves to them with flatteries . 	Anmahni ṭanpui tûra inpete chuan ti ṭhîn lo mah se ,  chûng mi thahte chuan ṭanpuina a tâwk a fang chu an dawng tho vang .  
Some of those who are wise shall fall ,  to refine them ,  and to purify ,  and to make them white ,  even to the time of the end ;  because it is yet for the time appointed .

The king shall do according to his will ;  and he shall exalt himself ,  and magnify himself above every god ,  and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods ;  and he shall prosper until the indignation be accomplished ;  for that which is determined shall be done . 	  “  Chu lal chu a duh duhin a che ang a ,  pathiante aia ropuiah a inngai ang a ,  pathiante Pathian meuh ai pawhin a indah sâng ang .

Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers ,  nor the desire of women ,  nor regard any god ;  for he shall magnify himself above all .

But in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses ;  and a god whom his fathers didn ' t know shall he honor with gold ,  and silver ,  and with precious stones ,  and pleasant things .

At the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him ;  and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind ,  with chariots ,  and with horsemen ,  and with many ships ;  and he shall enter into the countries ,  and shall overflow and pass through . 	  “  A hun tâwp dâwn hnaiah chuan Aigupta lal chuan a rawn bei ang a ;  mahse ,  Suria lal chuan tawlailîr te ,  sakawr chungchuang mi te leh lawng tam tak te nên theihtâwp chhuahin ṭhâwngaleivîr angin a lo bei lêt dâwn a ni .  
He shall enter also into the glorious land ,  and many  [ countries ]  shall be overthrown ;  but these shall be delivered out of his hand :  Edom ,  and Moab ,  and the chief of the children of Ammon .

Now isn ' t Boaz our kinsman ,  with whose maidens you were  ?   Behold ,  he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor . 	A chhiahhlawh nulate nêna hna i va thawhna pa kha kan laichîn bul Boaza a ni .  Ngai teh ,  zânin hi hruihah barli a zah fai zân a ni a . 
Therefore wash yourself ,  anoint yourself ,  get dressed ,  and go down to the threshing floor ,  but don ' t make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .

It shall be ,  when he lies down ,  that you shall mark the place where he shall lie ,  and you shall go in ,  and uncover his feet ,  and lay down ;  then he will tell you what you shall do .

She went down to the threshing floor ,  and did according to all that her mother - in - law told her . 	Tichuan ,  hruih lamah chuan a chhuk a ,  a pi hrilh ang chuan a ti ta a .  
When Boaz had eaten and drunk ,  and his heart was merry ,  he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain .  She came softly ,  uncovered his feet ,  and laid her down .

He said ,   " Who are you  ?   "  She answered ,   " I am Ruth your handmaid .  Therefore spread your skirt over your handmaid ;  for you are a near kinsman .  " 	  “  Tu nge i nih  ?  ” a ti a .

He said ,   " Blessed are you by Yahweh ,  my daughter .  You have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning ,  inasmuch as you didn ' t follow young men ,  whether poor or rich .

Stay this night ,  and it shall be in the morning ,  that if he will perform for you the part of a kinsman ,  well ;  let him do the kinsman ' s part .  But if he will not do the part of a kinsman for you ,  then will I do the part of a kinsman for you ,  as Yahweh lives .  Lie down until the morning .

She lay at his feet until the morning .  She rose up before one could discern another .  For he said ,   " Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor .

He said ,   " Bring the mantle that is on you ,  and hold it .  "  She held it ;  and he measured six  [ measures ]  of barley ,  and laid it on her ;  and he went into the city .

Then she said ,   " Sit still ,  my daughter ,  until you know how the matter will fall ;  for the man will not rest ,  until he has finished the thing this day .

Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me ,  and sat before me . 	Israel upa ṭhenkhat an lo kal a ,  ka hmaah an ṭhu a ,  
The word of Yahweh came to me ,  saying , 	Lalpa chuan ka hnênah ,  
Son of man ,  these men have taken their idols into their heart ,  and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face :  should I be inquired of at all by them  ?  	  “  Mihring fapa ,  hêng mite hian milem an vuan tlat a ,  an bawhchhiatna chu an tân dâltu a ni a ,  min râwn tûr em an nih  ?   
Therefore speak to them ,  and tell them ,  Thus says the Lord Yahweh :  Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart ,  and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face ,  and comes to the prophet ;  I Yahweh will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols ; 	Chuvângin ,  heti hian hrilh rawh :   ‘ Lalpa PATHIAN chuan heti hian a ti :  Israel mi tu pawh ,  milem vuan tlata ,  an bawhchhiatna chu anmahni dâltu ni ṭhîn mah se ,  zâwlnei râwn tûra an lo kal chuan ,  milem an ngah êm avângin kei Lalpa hian na takin ka lo chhâng ang .  
that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart ,  because they are all estranged from me through their idols . 	Israel chhûngte hian an milem avângin min hawisan nâ a ,  an thinlung ka hmin theih nân ka lo chhâng dâwn a ni . ’ 
Therefore tell the house of Israel ,  Thus says the Lord Yahweh :  Return ,  and turn yourselves from your idols ;  and turn away your faces from all your abominations . 	  “  Chuvângin ,  Israel chhûngte chu hrilh rawh :   ‘ Lalpa PATHIAN chuan heti hian a ti :  Lo kîr ula ,  in milemte hawisan ula ,  in thiltih tenawmte chu bânsan rawh u .  
For everyone of the house of Israel ,  or of the strangers who live in Israel ,  who separates himself from me ,  and takes his idols into his heart ,  and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face ,  and comes to the prophet to inquire for himself of me ;  I Yahweh will answer him by myself : 	Israel chhûng zînga mi emaw ,  an zînga chêng vête emaw ,  milem vuan tlata ,  an bawhchhiatna dâltua hmanga ,  ka laka intihrangte ,  an chungchâng thu - a zâwlnei hmanga mi râwn tûra lo kal chu ;  Kei Lalpa ,  kei ngei hian ka chhâng ang .  
and I will set my face against that man ,  and will make him an astonishment ,  for a sign and a proverb ,  and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ;  and you shall know that I am Yahweh . 	Ka lo sawisa ang a ,  ka mite zîng ata ka theh chhuak ang .  Miin an enbîk leh an sawi an ni ang a ,  Lalpa ka nih hi an hria ang . ’ 
If the prophet is deceived and speak a word ,  I ,  Yahweh ,  have deceived that prophet ,  and I will stretch out my hand on him ,  and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel . 	  “  Tin ,  zâwlnei chu buma awmin thu a sawi chuan ,  chu zâwlnei bumtu chu keimah ka ni a ,  ka kut a chungah ka lek ang a ,  ka mi Israel - te zîng ata ka tiboral ang .  
They shall bear their iniquity :  the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him who seeks  [ to him ]  ; 	Zâwlnei sualna leh a râwntu sualna chu a inang reng a ni ,  an sual mawh chu anmahni ngeiin an phur ang . 
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me ,  neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions ;  but that they may be my people ,  and I may be their God ,  says the Lord Yahweh . 	Tichuan ,  Israel chhûngte chu ka hnên ata an kal bo tawh lo vang a ,  milem avângin an bawrhbâng hek lo vang a ,  an bawh chhiatna avângin an bawlhhlawh hek lo vang a ,  ka mite an ni tawh zâwk ang a ,  an Pathian ka ni ang , ” Lalpa PATHIAN thuchhuak chuan a ti .  
The word of Yahweh came to me ,  saying , 	Lalpa chuan a sawi zêl a :  
Son of man ,  when a land sins against me by committing a trespass ,  and I stretch out my hand on it ,  and break the staff of its bread ,  and send famine on it ,  and cut off from it man and animal ; 	  “  Mihring fapa ,  ram chuan ka chungah nasa takin thil sual ti sela ,  ka kut ka lek ang a ,  an chaw hmuhna hnâr ka chhut chahsak ang a ,  rilṭâmin mihring leh sa an thi ang .  
though these three men ,  Noah ,  Daniel ,  and Job ,  were in it ,  they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness ,  says the Lord Yahweh . 	  “  Hêng mi ṭha pathum ,  Nova te ,  Danela te ,  Joba te hi awm ve mah se ,  an ṭhat avângin an nunna chauh an hum thei ang , ” Lalpa PATHIAN thuchhuak chuan a ti .  
If I cause evil animals to pass through the land ,  and they ravage it ,  and it be made desolate ,  so that no man may pass through because of the animals ; 	  “  Ram chhûngah ram sakawlh ka tirha ,  mi an seh hlum pheng phunga ,  rama mi an darh zawha ,  sa hlauh avânga kal ngam lohna hiala ka siamin ,  
though these three men were in it ,  as I live ,  says the Lord Yahweh ,  they should deliver neither sons nor daughters ;  they only should be delivered ,  but the land should be desolate . 	hêng mi pathumte hi awm ve mah se ,  an fanu fapate pawh an chhan thei lo vang ;  anmahni an inhum thei hrâm chauh ang a ,  ram chu a chhe zo vang .  PATHIAN ka nih hi , ” Mi nung Lalpa PATHIAN thuchhuak chuan a ti .  
Or if I bring a sword on that land ,  and say ,  Sword ,  go through the land ;  so that I cut off from it man and animal ; 	  “  Ram chhûngah khandaih ka tirha ,   ‘ Khandaihin ram hi fang chhuak sela ,  mi leh sa that rawh se , ’ ka tih chuan ,  
though these three men were in it ,  as I live ,  says the Lord Yahweh ,  they should deliver neither sons nor daughters ,  but they only should be delivered themselves . 	hêng mi pathumte hi awm ve mah se ,  an fanu fapate pawh an chhan thei lo vang ,  anmahni erawh chu an inhum thei hrâm ang .  Pathian nung ka nih hi , ” Lalpa PATHIAN thuchhuak chuan a ti .  
Or if I send a pestilence into that land ,  and pour out my wrath on it in blood ,  to cut off from it man and animal ; 	  “  Mi leh sa tiboral tûra hripui ka lêntîra ,  ka thinurna ka leih buak chuan ,  
though Noah ,  Daniel ,  and Job ,  were in it ,  as I live ,  says the Lord Yahweh ,  they should deliver neither son nor daughter ;  they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness . 	Nova te ,  Danela te ,  Joba te awm ve mah se ,  an fanu fapate pawh an chhan thei lo vang .  Kei Lalpa ,  Pathian nung ka nih hi , ” Lalpa PATHIAN thuchhuak chuan a ti :   ‘ An ṭhat avângin anmahni chu an inhum thei hrâm ang . ’ 
For thus says the Lord Yahweh :  How much more when I send my four severe judgments on Jerusalem ,  the sword ,  and the famine ,  and the evil animals ,  and the pestilence ,  to cut off from it man and animal ! 	Lalpa PATHIAN chuan heti hian a ti :    “  Ka hremna na pali  -   khandaih te ,  ṭâm te ,  hripui te ,  sakawlh te ,  mihring leh sa tiboral tûra Jerusalem - a ka tirh hun chuan a va râpthlâk dâwn êm !  
Yet ,  behold ,  therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth ,  both sons and daughters :  behold ,  they shall come forth to you ,  and you shall see their way and their doings ;  and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem ,  even concerning all that I have brought on it . 	An fanu fapate zînga thi bâng an awma ,  in hnêna an lo kal chuan ,  an khawsak dân leh an thil tihte chu in hmu ang a ,  Jerusalem chunga thil ṭha lo ka tih chu tih âwm rêng in ti ve ang .  
They shall comfort you ,  when you see their way and their doings ;  and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it ,  says the Lord Yahweh . 	An khawsak dân leh an thil tihte in hmuh hunah chuan ka thil tihte chu chhan ṭha tak awm lo chuan ka ti lo tih in hria ang a ,  a âwm in ti ang , ” Lalpa PATHIAN thuchhuak chuan a ti . 
It happened ,  when Saul was returned from following the Philistines ,  that it was told him ,  saying ,   " Behold ,  David is in the wilderness of En Gedi .  " 	Saulan Filistia mite a ûm chu a lo haw chuan ,    “  Ngai teh ,  Davida chu Engedi thlalêrah a awm e , ” tiin an hrilh a .  
Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel ,  and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats . 	Saula chuan Israel mi sângthum a thlan chhuahte nên chuan sathâr chênna lungpui hmuna Davida leh a hote awm chu a zawng ta a .  
He came to the sheep pens by the way ,  where there was a cave ;  and Saul went in to relieve himself .  Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave . 	An kalna kawng sirah chuan berâm huang a lo awm a .  Chutah chuan pûk a awm ,  Saula chu inthiar tûrin a va lût a ,  Davida leh a hote chu pûk chhûngril lamah chuan an lo awm reng a .  
The men of David said to him ,   " Behold ,  the day of which Yahweh said to you ,   ' Behold ,  I will deliver your enemy into your hand ,  and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you .  '  "  Then David arose ,  and cut off the skirt of Saul ' s robe secretly . 	Davida hote chuan ,    “  Lalpan i hnêna a sawi ,   ‘ Ngai teh ,  i hmêlma chu i kutah ka pe ang che ,  a chungah ṭha i tih angin ti ang che , ’ a tih kha a lo thleng ta a nih hi , ” an ti a .  Davida chu a tho va ,  a rûk têin Saula kawrfual hmâwr chu a va hlep a .  
It happened afterward ,  that David ' s heart struck him ,  because he had cut off Saul ' s skirt . 	Chumi hnu chuan Davida chuan Saula kawrfual hmâwr a hleh avâng chuan a inthiam lo hle a .  
He said to his men ,   " Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord ,  Yahweh ' s anointed ,  to put forth my hand against him ,  since he is Yahweh ' s anointed .  " 	A hote hnênah chuan ,    “  Lalpa hriakthih ,  ka pu chunga kut ka lo lek hi ka tih loh tawp tûr ka lo ti a ni ;  ani chu Lalpa hriakthih a ni ngei si a , ” a ti a .  
So David checked his men with these words ,  and didn ' t allow them to rise against Saul .  Saul rose up out of the cave ,  and went on his way . 	Davida chuan hêng thu hian a mite chu a thlêm dai a ,  Saula beih chu a remti ta lo va .  Saula pawh chu a tho va ,  pûk aṭang chuan a chhuak a ,  a kal leh ta a .  
David also arose afterward ,  and went out of the cave ,  and cried after Saul ,  saying ,   " My lord the king !  "  When Saul looked behind him ,  David bowed with his face to the earth ,  and did obeisance . 	Chumi hnu chuan Davida pawh chu a lo tho va ,  pûk aṭang chuan a lo chhuak a ,    “  Lalpa ,  ka lalpa , ” tiin Saula chu a au zui a ,  Saula chu a lo hawi a ,  Davida chuan bawkkhupin zah takin chibai a bûk a .  
David said to Saul ,   " Why do you listen to men ' s words ,  saying ,   ' Behold ,  David seeks your hurt  ?   ' 	Davida chuan Saula hnênah ,    “  Ngai teh ,   ‘ Davidan i chhiatna a zawng a ni , ’ tia miten i hnêna an sawi chu engah nge i awih ṭhin le  ?   
Behold ,  this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave .  Some urged me to kill you ;  but I spared you ;  and I said ,  I will not put forth my hand against my lord ;  for he is Yahweh ' s anointed . 	Ngai teh ,  vawiin hian he pûk chhûng ngeiah hian Lalpan ka kutah a hlân che tih nangmah ngeiin i hria .  That tûr chein mi ṭhenkhatin min nawr a ;  mahse ,  ka zuah che a ni .   ‘ Ka lalpa chungah kut ka thlâk lo vang ,  Lalpa hriakthih a ni si a ; ’ ka ti a ni .  
Moreover ,  my father ,  behold ,  yes ,  see the skirt of your robe in my hand ;  for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe ,  and didn ' t kill you ,  know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand ,  and I have not sinned against you ,  though you hunt for my life to take it . 	En teh ,  ka pu ,  i puan fêm ka ken reng hi ,  i puanfêm pawh ka hlep ngei a ;  mahse ,  ka that duh lo che a ni ;  i chungah ka hel lo va ,  thil sual tih pawh ka nei hek lo .  Thah tumin min zawng mah la ,  kei chuan i chungah thil sual tih ka duh lo tih hria ang che .  
May Yahweh judge between me and you ,  and may Yahweh avenge me of you ;  but my hand shall not be on you . 	Lalpa chuan nang nêna kan inkâr thu hi rêl sela ,  kei zawngin i chungah kut ka thlâk dâwn lo ,  Lalpa chuan i lakah phuba la zâwk rawh se . 
As the proverb of the ancients says ,   ' Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness ;  '  but my hand shall not be on you . 	Hmânlai thufingin ,   ‘ Mi sualin thil sual an ti ṭhîn , ’ a ti a ;  kei chuan i chungah kut ka thlâk lo vang .  
Against whom has the king of Israel come out  ?   Whom do you pursue  ?   A dead dog  ?   A flea  ?  	Israel lal chu tu beih tumin nge a lo chhuah  ?   Tu nge i ûm le ,  ui thisâwn nge uihli  ?   
May Yahweh therefore be judge ,  and give sentence between me and you ,  and see ,  and plead my cause ,  and deliver me out of your hand .  " 	Lalpa chuan nang nêna kan inkâr thu rêl sela ,  tifel rawh se .  Ka chungthu hi ngaihvenin mi sawipui sela ,  i kut ata mi chhan chhuak rawh se , ” a ti a .  
It came to pass ,  when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul ,  that Saul said ,   " Is this your voice ,  my son David  ?   "  Saul lifted up his voice ,  and wept . 	Chûng thu chu Davidan Saula hnêna a sawi zawhin Saula chuan ,    “  Ka fapa David ,  i aw a ni maw  ?  ” a ti a ,  ring takin a ṭap chhuak a . 
He said to David ,   " You are more righteous than I ;  for you have done good to me ,  whereas I have done evil to you . 	Davida hnênah chuan ,    “  Kei ai chuan i fel zâwk daih a ni ,  nang chuan ka chungah thil ṭha i ti a ,  kei erawh chuan thil ṭha lo ka ti a ni .  
You have declared this day how you have dealt well with me ,  because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand ,  you didn ' t kill me . 	Vawiin hian ka chunga i ṭhatzia i tilang ta ,  Lalpan i kuta min pêk pawhin min that duh lo va .  
For if a man finds his enemy ,  will he let him go away unharmed  ?   Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day . 	Miin a hmêlma hmu fuh sela ,  a khawih duh lo vang em ni  ?   Vawiina ka chunga i thil tih dânah hian Lalpa chuan thil ṭhain rûl che rawh se .  
Now ,  behold ,  I know that you shall surely be king ,  and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand . 	Ngai teh ,  lal i la ni ngei dâwn a ,  Israel - te lalram chu i kutah tihngheh a la ni ngei dâwn tih ka hre ta .  
Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh ,  that you will not cut off my seed after me ,  and that you will not destroy my name out of my father ' s house .  " 	Ka thlahte tiboral lo tûr leh ka pa chhûngkaw zîng ata ka hming thai bo lo tûrin tûnah Lalpa hming chhâlin chhia chham rawh khai , ” a ti a .  
David swore to Saul .  Saul went home ;  but David and his men went up to the stronghold . 	Tichuan ,  Davida chuan Saula hnênah chhia a chham a ;  Saula chu in lamah a hâwng a ,  Davida leh a hote chu an bihrûkna lamah an chho ta thung a . 
Now concerning things sacrificed to idols :  We know that we all have knowledge .  Knowledge puffs up ,  but love builds up . 	Milem biakna thil ei thu chu :  Kan za - in  ‘ hriatna’ kan nei ṭheuh tih kan hria a ,  chutiang  ‘ hriatna’ chuan mi a tichapo ṭhîn a ,  hmangaihna erawh chuan mi a siam ṭha ṭhîn .  
But if anyone thinks that he knows anything ,  he doesn ' t yet know as he ought to know . 	Tu pawhin thil hria nia a inngaih chuan a hriat tûr ang a la hre lo va ni .  
But if anyone loves God ,  the same is known by him . 	Miin Pathian a hmangaih erawh chuan Pathian mi hriat a ni .  
Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols ,  we know that no idol is anything in the world ,  and that there is no other God but one . 	Chutichuan ,  milem biakna thil hlan ei thu - ah chuan  -   khawvêlah hian milemte hi eng mah an nih lohzia leh ,  Pathian pakhat chauh lo chu a dang an awm lohzia kan hria .  
For though there are things that are called  " gods ,  "  whether in the heavens or on earth ;  as there are many  " gods "  and many  " lords ;  " 	Vânah emaw ,  leiah emaw pathian anga ngaih tam tak an awm thei a ,  chutiangin pathian tam tak leh lalpa tam tak an awm rêng a ni . 
yet to us there is one God ,  the Father ,  of whom are all things ,  and we for him ;  and one Lord ,  Jesus Christ ,  through whom are all things ,  and we live through him . 	Nimahsela ,  keini tân zawng Pathian pakhat chauh ,  Pa ,  engkim siamtu chu a awm a ;  keini pawh ama tâna awm kan ni ;  tin ,  Lalpa pakhat chauh ,  Krista chu a awm bawk a ;  thil engkim hi ama zâra siam a ni a ,  keini pawh ama zâra awm kan ni .  
However ,  that knowledge isn ' t in all men .  But some ,  with consciousness of the idol until now ,  eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol ,  and their conscience ,  being weak ,  is defiled . 	Amaherawhchu ,  chu hriatna chu mi zawng zawngin an nei vek lêm lo ,  tûn thlengin mi ṭhenkhat milem be ṭhang an nih avângin an thil ei chu milem hnêna inthawina anga ngaiin an ei ṭhîn a ;  an chhia leh ṭha hriatna a chak si lo va ,  bawlhhlawhin an inhre ṭhîn .  
But food will not commend us to God .  For neither ,  if we don ' t eat ,  are we the worse ;  nor ,  if we eat ,  are we the better . 	Eng pawh ni se ,  kan thil ei hian Pathian mit min tluntîr chuang lo ;  ei lo mah ila kan chhe chuang lo va ,  ei mah ila kan ṭha chuang hek lo .  
But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak . 	Amaherawhchu ,  fîmkhur rawh u ,  in zalênna hi engti kawngin emaw rinnaa chak lote tân tlûkna a lo ni hlauh dah ang e .  
For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol ' s temple ,  won ' t his conscience ,  if he is weak ,  be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols  ?  	Nang ,  chutiang hriatna nei ,  milem biakna ina i chaw ei lai ,  mi ,  a chhia leh ṭha hriatna chak lovin hmu ta che sela ,  milem hnêna thil hlante ei a ngam phah ve dâwn lâwm ni  ?   
And through your knowledge ,  he who is weak perishes ,  the brother for whose sake Christ died . 	Chuti a nih chuan i hriatna chu ringtu chak lo tân chhiatna a ni ang asin ;  ani tân pawh Krista chu a thi si a .  
Thus ,  sinning against the brothers ,  and wounding their conscience when it is weak ,  you sin against Christ . 	Chutianga unaute chunga in tihsuala ,  an chhia leh ṭha hriatna chu a chak loh nâk alaia ,  in hliam lehnghâl chuan Krista chunga thil tisual in ni .  
Therefore ,  if food causes my brother to stumble ,  I will eat no meat forevermore ,  that I don ' t cause my brother to stumble . 	Chuvângin ,  ei leh inin ka unau a tihtlûk si chuan ,  ka unau chu ka tihtlûk loh nân kumkhuain sa rêng ka ei tawh lo vang . 
Being therefore justified by faith ,  we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ; 	Tichuan ,  rin vânga thiam kan chan tâk avângin ,  kan Lal Isua Krista zârah Pathian nên inremin kan awm ta .  
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand .  We rejoice in hope of the glory of God . 	Amah avâng vêk chuan tûna kan awmna ,  khawngaihna hnuaiah hian ,  rinnain kan lût ta a ,  Pathian ropuina kan la ṭâwm tûr beiseina avângin kan lâwm bawk a ni .  
Not only this ,  but we also rejoice in our sufferings ,  knowing that suffering works perseverance ; 	Chu bâkah kan hrehawmnaah pawh kan lâwm zêl a ni ;  hrehawmna chuan chhelna a hring ṭhîn a ,  
and perseverance ,  proven character ;  and proven character ,  hope : 	chhelna pawh chuan nghehna a hring a ,  nghehna chuan beiseina a hring tih kan hre si a .  
and hope doesn ' t disappoint us ,  because God ' s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us . 	Chu beiseina chuan min tibeidawng lo va .  Thlarau Thianghlim min pêk hmangin kan thinlungah hian Pathian chuan a hmangaihna chu a rawn leih ta si a .  
For while we were yet weak ,  at the right time Christ died for the ungodly . 	Eng mah ti thei lo kan nih lai khân a hun takah Krista chu mi sualte tân a lo thi ta si a .  
For one will hardly die for a righteous man .  Yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die . 	Mi fel tâna thih chu tu tân pawh a har hle ang ,  mi ṭha tân erawh chuan thih ngam an awm mial mahna . 
But God commends his own love toward us ,  in that while we were yet sinners ,  Christ died for us . 	Amaherawhchu ,  Pathianin min hmangaihzia a lanna chu  -   mi sual kan nih reng laiin Krista kan tân zu thi a !  
Much more then ,  being now justified by his blood ,  we will be saved from God ' s wrath through him . 	A thisen avâng chuan Pathianin thiam min rawn chantîr ta a ;  thinurna lak ata chu ama zârah min va chhan chhuak dâwn êm !  
For if ,  while we were enemies ,  we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son ,  much more ,  being reconciled ,  we will be saved by his life . 	Hmêlma kan nih lai maha a Fapa thihna azâra Pathian nên kan inrem tawh si chuan ,  Pathian nêna inrema kan awm hnu phei chuan ,  Krista nunna avângin chhandam kan va ni dâwn tehlul êm !  
Not only so ,  but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ ,  through whom we have now received the reconciliation . 	Chu chauh chu a ni lo ,  tûna inremna min petu kan Lalpa Isua Krista zârah chuan Pathianah kan lâwm bawk a ni .  
Therefore ,  as sin entered into the world through one man ,  and death through sin ;  and so death passed to all men ,  because all sinned . 	Khawvêlah hian mi pakhat avângin sual a lo lût a ,  sual avâng chuan thihna a lo awm ta a .  Tichuan ,  khawvêl mihring hi thihna chuan a fan chhuak ta a ni ,  mi zawng zawngin thil sual an tih avângin .  
For until the law ,  sin was in the world ;  but sin is not charged when there is no law . 	Dân a awm hma pawhin khawvêlah sual a awm tawh ;  mahse ,  Dân a awm loh avângin sual chu suala ngaih a ni lo .  
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses ,  even over those whose sins weren ' t like Adam ' s disobedience ,  who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come . 	Nimahsela ,  Adama hun aṭanga Mosia hun thlengin ,  mi chungah Adaman Pathian thupêk awih lova thil sual a tih tâk anga sual ti ve lote chungah pawh thihna chuan thu a nei a .  Adama chu lo kal tûra nên tehkhin a ni .  
But the free gift isn ' t like the trespass .  For if by the trespass of the one the many died ,  much more did the grace of God ,  and the gift by the grace of the one man ,  Jesus Christ ,  abound to the many . 	Nimahsela ,  Pathian thilthlâwnpêk chu Adama sual nên chuan inang lo tak a ni  -   kha mi pakhat sual avâng khân mi tam tak an thi a :  Pathian khawngaihna leh mi pakhat ,  Isua Krista avânga a thilthlâwnpêk chu tam takin an dawng thung a ni .  
The gift is not as through one who sinned :  for the judgment came by one to condemnation ,  but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification . 	Pathian thilpêk leh mi pakhat sual chu inang lo tak a ni sual pakhat avângin thiam loh channa a lo awm a ;  amaherawhchu ,  sual tam tak avângin khawngaiha thiam channa a lo awm ta .  
For if by the trespass of the one ,  death reigned through the one ;  so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one ,  Jesus Christ . 	Mi pakhat ,  mi mal sualna avânga khawvêlah hian thihnain ro a rêl ta a nih si chuan ,  mi pakhat bawk ,  Isua Krista avângin ,  Pathian khawngaihna nasa tak leh a thilthlâwnpêk thiam channa dawngtute chuan ,  nun changin ropui takin ro an rêl ngei ang .  
So then as through one trespass ,  all men were condemned ;  even so through one act of righteousness ,  all men were justified to life . 	Tichuan ,  mi pakhat sual avângin mi thiam loh chantîr an ni a ,  chutiang bawkin mi pakhat dik avângin mi thiam changin an nung thei ta a ni .  
For as through the one man ' s disobedience many were made sinners ,  even so through the obedience of the one ,  many will be made righteous . 	Mi pakhat thu awih lohna avâng khân mi tam tak mi sual an ni ta a ,  chutiang bawkin mi pakhat thuawihna avângin mi tam tak mi dik an ni ang .  
The law came in besides ,  that the trespass might abound ;  but where sin abounded ,  grace abounded more exceedingly ; 	Sual a lan chian lehzual theih nân Dân a lo awm a ;  nimahsela ,  sual a nasat poh leh khawngaihna a nasa lehzual ṭhîn a .  
that as sin reigned in death ,  even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord . 	Tichuan ,  sual chuan thihnain ro a rêl a ;  kan Lalpa Isua Krista zâra chatuan nun kan neih theih nân Pathian khawngaihna chuan thiam chantîrnain ro a rêl ta a ni . 
Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom ,   " Let me now choose twelve thousand men ,  and I will arise and pursue after David tonight . 	Ahitofela chuan Absaloma hnênah ,    “  Mi sîngkhat leh sânghnih ka thlang chhuak ang a ,  zâninah Davida ka va ûm teh ang .  
I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted ,  and will make him afraid .  All the people who are with him shall flee .  I will strike the king only ; 	A chauh chhiat lai tak ka va nangchîng ang a ,  ka ṭhâwng thut ang a ,  a mite zawng zawngin an tlânchhiatsan ang a ,  amah chu ka va that mai ang .  
and I will bring back all the people to you .  The man whom you seek is as if all returned .  All the people shall be in peace .  " 	Tichuan ,  mite chu ,  mo ,  a pasal hnêna a lawi angin i hnênah ka rawn hruai kîr vek ang .  Thah i tum mi pakhat bâk chu an him vek ang , ” a ti a .  
The saying pleased Absalom well ,  and all the elders of Israel . 	Chu thurâwn chu Absaloma leh Israel upaho chuan ṭha an ti hle a .  
Then Absalom said ,   " Now call Hushai the Archite also ,  and let us hear likewise what he says .  " 	Absaloma chuan ,    “  Ark mi Husaia han ko ula ,  eng nge sawi tûr a neih i lo ngaithla ve phawt teh ang , ” a ti a .  
When Hushai was come to Absalom ,  Absalom spoke to him ,  saying ,   " Ahithophel has spoken like this .  Shall we do what he says  ?   If not ,  speak up .  " 	Husaia chu a lo kal a ,  Absaloma chuan a hnênah ,    “  Ahitofela chuan hetiangin thu min râwn a ,  a sawi ang hian kan ti ang em  ?   Ṭha i tih loh chuan i ngaih dân han sawi ve teh , ” a ti a .  
Hushai said to Absalom ,   " The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good .  " 	Husaia chuan Absaloma hnênah ,    “  Tûn ṭuma Ahitofela remruat hi a ṭha lo va ni .  
Hushai said moreover ,   " You know your father and his men ,  that they are mighty men ,  and they are fierce in their minds ,  like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field .  Your father is a man of war ,  and will not lodge with the people . 	I pa mite chu i hria a ,  râl beih thiam ,  savawm a notê an lâksak ang maia kawlhsen an ni a .  Chu bâkah ,  i pa hi râl rêl thiam a ni a ,  a sipaite zîngah a riak kher lo vang .  
Behold ,  he is now hidden in some pit ,  or in some other place .  It will happen ,  when some of them have fallen at the first ,  that whoever hears it will say ,   ' There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom !  ' 	Tûnah pawh pûkah emaw ,  hmun dangah emaw a biru daih ang .  In inbei chauh tiha i mite an thih hlauh phei chuan a hria apiangin ,   ‘ Absaloma sipaite an that chiam mai , ’ an ti ang a .  
Even he who is valiant ,  whose heart is as the heart of a lion ,  will utterly melt ;  for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man ,  and those who are with him are valiant men . 	Sipai huaisen ,  sakeibaknei rilru pute pawh hlauvin an khûr ang a ,  Israel mi zawng zawngin i pa indo thiamzia ,  a hotute huaisenzia te an hre vek si a .  
But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you ,  from Dan even to Beersheba ,  as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ;  and that you go to battle in your own person . 	Hetiangin ti zâwk teh :  Israel mi ,  Dan leh Beer - seba inkâra awm zawng zawng chu tuifinriat ṭiauvut zât ngawt ko khâwm la ,  nangmah ngeiin indonaah chuan hma hruai la ;  
So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found ,  and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground ;  and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one . 	tichuan ,  kan hmuhna apiangah kan bei ang a ,  leia dai tla ang maiin ani chu kan bei tluar tluar ang a ;  a hote nên pakhat mah kan zuah lo vang . 
Moreover ,  if he be gone into a city ,  then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city ,  and we will draw it into the river ,  until there isn ' t one small stone found there .  " 	Khuaa a tlân luh chuan Israel mi zawng zawng hruizên nên kan thawk ang a ,  a khaw chawpin kawrah kan hnuk thla mai ang ,  lungtê pakhat pawh kan zuah lo vang , ” a ti a . 
Absalom and all the men of Israel said ,   " The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel .  "  For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel ,  to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom . 	Absaloma leh Israel mite chuan   “  Ark mi Husaia remruat chu Ahitofela remruat aiin a ṭha zâwk , ” an ti a .  Absaloma chhiatna tûrin Ahitofela remruat ṭha tak chu Lalpa chuan dâl a lo tum rêng a ni .   
Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests ,   " Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way ;  and I have counseled this way . 	Husaia chuan puithiam Zadoka leh Abiathara hnênah chuan Ahitofelan Absaloma leh Israel upate rem a ruatpui dân te ,  amah pawhin rem a ruatpui dânte a hrilh bawk a . 
Now therefore send quickly ,  and tell David ,  saying ,   ' Don ' t lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness ,  but by all means pass over ;  lest the king be swallowed up ,  and all the people who are with him .  '  " 	  “  Zâninah thlalêr lui kaia riak tawh lovin lui chu kân ngei rawh se .  Chutilo zawng ,  lal leh a hote chu an rawn man vek mai ang’ tiin Davida chu hrilh thuai rawh u , ” a ti a . 
Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel ;  and a female servant used to go and tell them ;  and they went and told king David .  For they might not be seen to come into the city . 	Jonathana leh Ahimaaza chu Jerusalem daifêm ,  En - Rogel - ah an awm a .  Bawihnu pakhat hian anni chu thu thar a va hrilh ṭhîn a ,  annin Davida an hrilh chhâwng leh ṭhîn a ni .  Khawpuia an lût chu tu man an hmu tûr a ni si lo va .  
But a boy saw them ,  and told Absalom .  Then they both went away quickly ,  and came to the house of a man in Bahurim ,  who had a well in his court ;  and they went down there . 	Naupang pakhat hian a lo hmu hlauh va ,  Absaloma a hrilh a ;  tichuan ,  anni pahnih chu an tlân bo ta thuai a ,  Bahurim - a mi pakhat inah an tlân lût a .  Ani chuan a tualah tuichhunchhuah a nei a ,  a chhûngah chuan an lût ta a .  
The woman took and spread the covering over the well ' s mouth ,  and spread out bruised grain on it ;  and nothing was known . 	In neitupa nupui chuan a chhinnain tuichhunchhuah chu a chhîn a ,  a chungah buh a pho va ;  tu man an hmu lo va .  
Absalom ' s servants came to the woman to the house ;  and they said ,   " Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan  ?   "  The woman said to them ,   " They have gone over the brook of water .  "  When they had sought and could not find them ,  they returned to Jerusalem . 	Absaloma chhiahhlawhte chu hmeichhe hnênah chuan an va kal a ,  a hnênah ,    “  Ahimaaza leh Jonathana te kha khawiah nge an awm  ?  ” an ti a .

It happened ,  after they had departed ,  that they came up out of the well ,  and went and told king David ;  and they said to David ,   " Arise and pass quickly over the water ;  for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you .  " 	Chûng mite kal liam hnu chuan anni chu tuichhunchhuah ata chu an lo chhuak a ,  lal Davida chu an hrilh ta a ,  a hnênah ,    “  Tho la ,  lui hi kân thuai rawh u ,  Ahitofela chuan in chhiatna a zawng rêng si a , ” an ti a .  
Then David arose ,  and all the people who were with him ,  and they passed over the Jordan .  By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan . 	Davida leh a hote chu an chhuak a ,  Jordan lui chu varṭianah an kai vek a .  
When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed ,  he saddled his donkey ,  and arose ,  and went home ,  to his city ,  and set his house in order ,  and hanged himself ;  and he died ,  and was buried in the tomb of his father .

Then David came to Mahanaim .  Absalom passed over the Jordan ,  he and all the men of Israel with him . 	Absaloma leh a hnêna Israel awm zawng zawngin Jordan lui an kai lai chuan Davida chuan Mahanaim a thleng a .  
Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab .  Now Amasa was the son of a man ,  whose name was Ithra the Israelite ,  who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash ,  sister to Zeruiah ,  Joab ' s mother .

Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead . 	Israel mite leh Absaloma chuan Gilead ramah ṭanhmun an khuar a .  
It happened ,  when David was come to Mahanaim ,  that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon ,  and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar ,  and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim , 	Davida chuan Mahanaim khua a thlen chuan Amon mi ,  Raba khuaa Nahasa fapa Sobia te ,  Lo - debar khua aṭanga Amiela fapa Makira te ,  Rogelim aṭanga Gilead mi Barzilaia te chuan puanthuah te ,

and honey ,  and butter ,  and sheep ,  and cheese of the herd ,  for David ,  and for the people who were with him ,  to eat :  for they said ,   " The people are hungry ,  and weary ,  and thirsty ,  in the wilderness .

The words of Amos ,  who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa ,  which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah ,  and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel ,  two years before the earthquake .

He said :   " Yahweh will roar from Zion ,  and utter his voice from Jerusalem ;  and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn ,  and the top of Carmel will wither .

Thus says Yahweh :   " For three transgressions of Damascus ,  yes ,  for four ,  I will not turn away its punishment ;  because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron ; 	Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :    “  Damaska mite chu chin tâwk nei lovin an sual a ,  Ka hrem dâwn a ni .

I will break the bar of Damascus ,  and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven ,  and him who holds the scepter from the house of Eden ;  and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir ,  "  says Yahweh .

Thus says Yahweh :   " For three transgressions of Edom ,  yes ,  for four ,  I will not turn away its punishment ;  because he pursued his brother with the sword ,  and cast off all pity ,  and his anger raged continually ,  and he kept his wrath forever ; 	Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :    “  Edom mite chu chin tâwk nei lovin an sual a ,  Ka hrem dâwn a ni .

Thus says Yahweh :   " For three transgressions of the children of Ammon ,  yes ,  for four ,  I will not turn away its punishment ;  because they have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead ,  that they may enlarge their border .

I exhort therefore ,  first of all ,  that petitions ,  prayers ,  intercessions ,  and givings of thanks ,  be made for all men : 	Ka chah duh hmasak ber che chu thil dîlna te ,  ṭawngṭaina te ,  dîlsakna te ,  lâwmthu hrilhna te mi tân hlân ula ,

who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth . 	Ani chuan mi chhandama awmah leh thutak hria atân a duh si a .  
For there is one God ,  and one mediator between God and men ,  the man Christ Jesus , 	Pathian pakhat chauh a awm a ,  Pathian leh mihring inkârah palai pakhat chauh a awm bawk ,  mihring Krista Isua chu .  
who gave himself as a ransom for all ;  the testimony in its own times ; 	Mi tlan nân ani chu a inpe a ,  chhandamna thu chu hun a tih takah a rawn puang ta .  
to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle  ( I am telling the truth in Christ ,  not lying )  ,  a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .

In the same way ,  that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing ,  with modesty and propriety ;  not just with braided hair ,  gold ,  pearls ,  or expensive clothing ; 	Hmeichhia pawh a mawi tâwk leh inchawih tâwkin inchei sela ,  sam chei lêrh te ,  rangkachaka inchei te ,  tuikeplung ṭhi awrh te ,  puan man tam inbel te chîng suh se .  
but  ( which becomes women professing godliness )  with good works . 	Pathian ngaihsak hmeichhiate tih âwm rêng ,  thil tih ṭhatein inthuam zâwk rawh se .  
Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection . 	Hmeichhiate chuan ngawi rengin ,  thu awih takin thil an zir tûr a ni .  
But I don ' t permit a woman to teach ,  nor to exercise authority over a man ,  but to be in quietness . 	Hmeichhiain an zirtîr te ,  mipa chunga thu an neih te ka phal lo ,  ngawih an chuh tûr a ni .  
For Adam was first formed ,  then Eve . 	Adama chu Evi ai chuan siam hmasak a ni a ,  
Adam wasn ' t deceived ,  but the woman ,  being deceived ,  has fallen into disobedience ; 	buma awm kha Adama a ni lo va ,  hmeichhia kha a ni buma awm leh bawhchhetu chu .  
but she will be saved through her childbearing ,  if they continue in faith ,  love ,  and sanctification with sobriety . 	Amaherawhchu ,  rinnaah te ,  hmangaihnaah te ,  thianghlimnaah te ,  mawi taka an awm reng phawt chuan fa hrin avângin chhandam an ni ang . 
The people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh .  When Yahweh heard it ,  his anger was kindled ;  and Yahweh ' s fire burnt among them ,  and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp .

The people cried to Moses ;  and Moses prayed to Yahweh ,  and the fire abated . 	Mite chuan Mosia an au va ,  ani chuan Lalpa hnênah a dîl a ,  mei chu a rêm ta a .  
The name of that place was called Taberah ,  because Yahweh ' s fire burnt among them . 	Lalpa mei an zînga a chhuah avângin chu hmun hmingah chuan Tabera an vuah a . 
The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly :  and the children of Israel also wept again ,  and said ,   " Who will give us flesh to eat  ?  	Israel - te zîngah hnam dang tel ve zêl an awm a ,  chûng chuan sa an châk hle a ,  Israel mite pawh chuan ,    “  Sa kan va châk ve le :  
We remember the fish ,  which we ate in Egypt for nothing ;  the cucumbers ,  and the melons ,  and the leeks ,  and the onions ,  and the garlic ; 	Aigupta ramah lah khân duh duhin sangha kan ei a ,  a man sawi tham a ni si lo ;  fanghma te ,  dawnfawh te ,  zo - purûn te ,  vai - purûnsen te ,  vai - purûnvâr te tak kha aw :  
but now we have lost our appetite .  There is nothing at all except this manna to look at .  " 	Kan va râwp ta ve ,  mana mai lo hi chu thil dang lah a awm si lo , ” an ti a .  
The manna was like coriander seed ,  and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium . 	Mana chu chhibung vâr ang deuh ,  tuikeplung anga vâr hi a ni .  
The people went around ,  gathered it ,  and ground it in mills ,  or beat it in mortars ,  and boiled it in pots ,  and made cakes of it .  Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil .

When the dew fell on the camp in the night ,  the manna fell on it . 	Zânah dai tlâk rualin mana chu a lo tla ve ṭhîn .  
Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families ,  every man at the door of his tent ;  and the anger of Yahweh was kindled greatly ;  and Moses was displeased . 	A chhûng chhûngin an phun a ,  an bûk kawngka bula an âng sup sup chu Mosian a lo hria a .  Lalpa chu an chungah a thinur viau tih a hriat chuan Mosia chu a mangang ta hle a .  
Moses said to Yahweh ,   " Why have you treated with your servant so badly  ?   Why haven ' t I found favor in your sight ,  that you lay the burden of all this people on me  ?  	Lalpa hnênah ,    “  Engtizia nge min va timangang ve  ?   Hêng mite mawh hi engtizia nge min phurhtîr ,  min va khawngaih lo ve  ?   
Have I conceived all this people  ?   Have I brought them forth ,  that you should tell me ,   ' Carry them in your bosom ,  as a nurse carries a nursing infant ,  to the land which you swore to their fathers  ?   ' 	Hêng mite hi ka fate pawh an ni lo va ,  engtizia nge nau hnute hne lai nuin a pua ang hrima an pate hnêna pêk i tiam ram paw thleng tûra min tih le  ?   
Where could I get meat to give to all this people  ?   For they weep to me ,  saying ,   ' Give us meat ,  that we may eat .  ' 	Khawi lama sa nge kei tehlulin ka pêk ang  ?    ‘ Sa kan châk êm mai ,  min pe rawh , ’ tiin ṭap chungin min rawn nawr buai hi  ?   
I am not able to bear all this people alone ,  because it is too heavy for me . 	Keimah mai zawngin hêng mite hi ka tuar dâwn lo ,  a hahthlâk lutuk .  
If you treat me this way ,  please kill me right now ,  if I have found favor in your sight ;  and don ' t let me see my wretchedness .  " 	Hetianga min tih dâwn zawngin min khawngaih la ,  min tihlum zâwk mai teh ,  heti taka tihretheih hi zawng ka peih ta lo , ” a ti a .  
Yahweh said to Moses ,   " Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel ,  whom you know to be the elders of the people ,  and officers over them ;  and bring them to the Tent of Meeting ,  that they may stand there with you . 	Lalpa chuan Mosia hnênah ,    “  Mipui zînga hruaitu deuh deuh mi sawmsarih han khâwm la ,  Inbiakna bûkah rawn hruai la ,  i bulah lo ding teh se .  
I will come down and talk with you there .  I will take of the Spirit which is on you ,  and will put it on them ;  and they shall bear the burden of the people with you ,  that you not bear it yourself alone . 	Ka lo chhuk ang a ,  ka rawn be dâwn che nia .  I chunga thlarau awm kha ka sem ve ang ,  mipui enkawlna mawh chu nangmah maiin i phur tawh lo vang a ,  an phurhpui tawh ang che .  
 " Say to the people ,   ' Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow ,  and you will eat flesh ;  for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh ,  saying ,   " Who will give us flesh to eat  ?   For it was well with us in Egypt .  "  Therefore Yahweh will give you flesh ,  and you will eat . 	Mipui hnênah ,   ‘ Naktûk atân inserh thianghlim rawh u ,  sa in ei dâwn e ;   ‘ sa ei tûr nei teh ila aw ,  Aigupta rama a tam ṭhin vei nên , ’ tia in sa châk ṭap thâwm chu Lalpa beng a thleng a ni ;  Lalpa chuan sa a pe ngei dâwn a che u ,  in ei mawlh ang .

but a whole month ,  until it come out at your nostrils ,  and it is loathsome to you ;  because that you have rejected Yahweh who is among you ,  and have wept before him ,  saying ,   " Why did we come out of Egypt  ?   "  '  " 	a thlaa thla khat pumhlûm ,  luakchhuak hlui khawpin in ei ang a ,  a ngei hluah hluah ang che u ,   ‘ Engtiziaa Aigupta ram chhuahsan ta mai nge maw kan nih le  ?  ’ tiin in zînga awm Lalpa chu in hnâwl a ,  ṭapin in nawr buai si a , ’ ti ang che , ” a ti a .  
Moses said ,   " The people ,  among whom I am ,  are six hundred thousand men on foot ;  and you have said ,   ' I will give them flesh ,  that they may eat a whole month .  ' 	Mosia chuan ,    “  Ka mi hruaite hi ,  mahni kea kal thei ngawt pawh ,  mi nuairuk zet an ni a ,   ‘ thla khat pumhlûm an ei tûr sa ka pe dâwn’ i ti a ,  
Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them ,  to be sufficient for them  ?   Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them ,  to be sufficient for them  ?   " 	berâm leh ran rual zawng zawng pawh talh ila ,  an ei khawp a tling dâwn em ni  ?   Tuifinriat sangha zawng zawng pawh man ila ,  an kham dâwn em ni  ?  ” a ti a .  
Yahweh said to Moses ,   " Has Yahweh ' s hand grown short  ?   Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not .  " 	Lalpa chuan Mosia hnênah ,    “  Tih theih loh ka nei ta em ni  ?   Ka sawi anga thil a awm dâwn leh dâwn loh i hre mai ang , ” a ti a .  
Moses went out ,  and told the people the words of Yahweh ;  and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people ,  and set them around the Tent . 	Mosia chu a chhuak a ,  Lalpa thu chu mipuite a hrilh a ,  an upa sawmsarihte chu a hruai a ,  Biakbûk vêlah chuan a dintîr a .  
Yahweh came down in the cloud ,  and spoke to him ,  and took of the Spirit that was on him ,  and put it on the seventy elders :  and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them ,  they prophesied ,  but they did so no more . 	Lalpa chu chhûmah a lo chhuk a ,  a rawn bia a ;  a chunga thlarau dah ṭhenkhat chu a la a ,  mi sawmsarihte chungah chuan a dah a ;  chutia an chunga thlarau a lo awm veleh chuan zâwlnei angin thu an sawi ta a ,  rei erawh chu an sawi lo .  
But two men remained in the camp .  The name of one was Eldad ,  and the name of the other Medad :  and the Spirit rested on them ;  and they were of those who were written ,  but had not gone out to the Tent ;  and they prophesied in the camp . 	Sawmsarih zînga tel mi pahnih Eldada leh Medada chu Biakbûk kal ve lovin an riahhmunah an awm a ,  anni pawh chuan zâwlnei angin thu an sawi ve bawk a .  
A young man ran ,  and told Moses ,  and said ,   " Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp !  " 	Tlangvâl pakhat hi Mosia hnênah a lo tlân a ,    “  Eldada leh Medadan riahhmunah thu an sawi bual bual mai , ” a rawn ti a .  
Joshua the son of Nun ,  the servant of Moses ,  one of his chosen men ,  answered ,   " My lord Moses ,  forbid them !  " 	Mosia puitu Josua ,  Nuna fapa chuan ,    “  Ka pu ,  khap teh , ” a ti a . 
Moses said to him ,   " Are you jealous for my sake  ?   I wish that all Yahweh ' s people were prophets ,  that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them !

Moses went into the camp ,  he and the elders of Israel . 	Mosia leh upa sawmsarihte chu riahbûk lamah an haw a .   
A wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea ,  and let them fall by the camp ,  about a day ' s journey on this side ,  and a day ' s journey on the other side ,  around the camp ,  and about two cubits above the surface of the earth .

The people rose up all that day ,  and all the night ,  and all the next day ,  and gathered the quails .  He who gathered least gathered ten homers ;  and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp .

While the flesh was yet between their teeth ,  before it was chewed ,  the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people ,  and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague . 	A sa an ei mêk lai chuan Lalpa thin an tiur a ,  an zîngah hri na tak a lêng ta a .  
The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah ,  because there they buried the people who lusted . 	Mi râwp tak takte chu chutah chuan an phûm avângin chu hmun chu Kibrot - hatava an vuah a . 
From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth ;  and they stayed at Hazeroth . 	Kibrot - hatava aṭang chuan Hazaroth - ah an insawn a ,  chutah chuan an châm rei ta deuh va .

Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name .  Worship Yahweh in holy array . 	Lalpa hming ropui tak chu fak ula ,  Thianghlimna silhfên inbelin Lalpa hmaah lo kûn rawh u .  
Yahweh ' s voice is on the waters .  The God of glory thunders ,  even Yahweh on many waters . 	Tui chungahte chuan Lalpan aw a chhuah a ,  Pathian ropui chuan khawpui a tiri a ,  Tuifinriat chungahte chuan a ri dur dur a .  
Yahweh ' s voice is powerful .  Yahweh ' s voice is full of majesty . 	Lalpa aw chu thiltithei tak a ni ,  Lalpa aw chu a ropui ngei mai .  
The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars .  Yes ,  Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon . 	Lalpa aw chuan sidar thingte a titliak a ,  A ni ,  Lalpan Lebanon sidar thingte chu a titliak rem rum mai .  
He makes them also to skip like a calf ;  Lebanon and Sirion like a young ,  wild ox . 	Lebanon chu bâwng notê ang maiin a zuantîr a ,  Sirion tlâng chu ramsial notê angin .  
Yahweh ' s voice strikes with flashes of lightning . 	Lalpa aw chuan kâwl a tiphe a ,  
Yahweh ' s voice shakes the wilderness .  Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh . 	Lalpa aw chuan thlalêr a tinghîng a ,  Lalpan Kades thlalêrte chu a tinghing a .  
Yahweh ' s voice makes the deer calve ,  and strips the forests bare .  In his temple everything says ,   " Glory !  " 	Lalpa aw chuan zukpuite no a chhiattîr a ,  Ngawa thinghnahte a tiṭîl vek ṭhîn a ,  A tempul - ah chuan ,    “  A va ropui em ! ” an ti .  
Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood .  Yes ,  Yahweh sits as King forever . 	Lalpa chu Tuilêt chungah a ṭhu a ,  A ni ,  Lalpa chuan kumkhuain ro a rêl ang .  
Yahweh will give strength to his people .  Yahweh will bless his people with peace .  A Psalm .  A Song for the Dedication of the Temple .  By David . 	Lalpan a mite chu a tichak ang a ,  Lalpan a mite chu muanna a pe bawk ang . 
Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor ,  that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed . 	Chhiahhlawh ,  bawih nghâwngkawl bâtte chuan an pute chu kawng engkimah an zah tûr a ni ,  chuti lo chu Pathian hming leh kan zirtîrna hi sawichhiat a ni dah ang e .  
Those who have believing masters ,  let them not despise them ,  because they are brothers ,  but rather let them serve them ,  because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved .  Teach and exhort these things . 	Bawih ,  Kristian pu neite chuan rinnaa unau an nih denchhenin an pute chu an ngainêp tûr a ni lo ,  ṭha lehzualin rawng an bâwlsak zâwk tûr a ni ;  an rawngbâwlsakte nên rinna leh hmangaihnaa chhûngkhat an ni si a .

If anyone teaches a different doctrine ,  and doesn ' t consent to sound words ,  the words of our Lord Jesus Christ ,  and to the doctrine which is according to godliness , 	Tu pawh kan Lalpa Isua Krista thutak leh sakhaw zirtîrna thu dik chu kalha zirtîrna danglam zirtîr chu ,  
he is conceited ,  knowing nothing ,  but obsessed with arguments ,  disputes ,  and word battles ,  from which come envy ,  strife ,  insulting ,  evil suspicions , 	mi â ,  intivei tak ,  eng mah hre si lo an ni ;  sawihnâwm tûr zawn thiam tak ,  inhnial châk hliah hliah ,  inîtsîkna te ,  innghirnghona te ,  Pathian pawi sawi te leh thu inchuh tâwpintai nei lo chawk chhuaktu an ni ;  
constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth ,  who suppose that godliness is a means of gain .  Withdraw yourself from such . 	rilru chhe tawh ,  thu dik man pha tawh lo ,  sakhua hi hausak nâna hman tumte an ni .  
But godliness with contentment is great gain . 	Mahni ta - a lungawite tân chuan sakhaw mi nih hi a hlâwk rêng a ni .  
For we brought nothing into the world ,  and we certainly can ' t carry anything out . 	Khawvêlah hian eng mah kan luhpui lo va ,  eng mah kan chhuahpui thei dâwn bawk hek lo .  
But having food and clothing ,  we will be content with that . 	Ei tûr leh silh tûr kan neih chuan kan tân a tâwk a ni .  
But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts ,  such as drown men in ruin and destruction . 	Hausak duh mite chu thlêmnaah an lût a ,  duhâmna âtthlâk ,  thang hlauhawm takah chuan an âwk a ,  an chhiat phah a ,  an boral ṭhîn a ni . 
For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil .  Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed ,  and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows . 	Tangka sum ngainat hi sual tinrêng bul a ni ,  sum ngah an tumna lamah ṭhenkhat chuan rinna hi an pênsan a ,  lungngaih sawi sên lohvin mahni an intina ta a ni .  
But you ,  man of God ,  flee these things ,  and follow after righteousness ,  godliness ,  faith ,  love ,  patience ,  and gentleness . 	Nang ,  Pathian mi ,  chûng chu tlânsan la ,  dikna te ,  sakhaw ngaihsakna te ,  rinna te ,  hmangaihna te ,  dawhtheihna te ,  nunnêmna te neih tum tlat zâwk rawh .  
Fight the good fight of faith .  Lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called ,  and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses . 	Rinna hlu tak hi ṭanin theihtâwp chhuah ang che ;  chatuan nun chu vuan tlat la ,  chumi chang tûr chuan koh i ni a ,  hretu tam tak hmaah rinna hi i pawm thu i puan kha .  
I command you before God ,  who gives life to all things ,  and before Christ Jesus ,  who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession , 	Engkim nunna hnâr ,  Pathian leh Krista Isua ,  Pontia Pilata hmaa hlau hlek lova thu dik ṭan tlattu hmaah chuan ,  
that you keep the commandment without spot ,  blameless ,  until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ; 	i tih tûra ruat chu rinawm taka ti tûrin thu ka pe a che .  Kan Lalpa Isua Krista lo lan leh hma chu bawlhhlawh kai lo leh sawisêlbovin awm rawh .  
which in its own times he will show ,  who is the blessed and only Ruler ,  the King of kings ,  and Lord of lords ; 	Fak tlâk Pathian ,  engkim chunga thu neitu awm chhun ,  lalberte Lalber ,  lalte Lal chuan a hun takah Krista chu a rawn lantîr dâwn si a .  
who alone has immortality ,  dwelling in unapproachable light ;  whom no man has seen ,  nor can see :  to whom be honor and eternal power .  Amen .

Charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty ,  nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches ,  but on the living God ,  who richly provides us with everything to enjoy ; 	Khawvêl mi hausate chu inchhuang lo tûrin hrilh la ,  sum rin tlâk loh rin chhan tum lova engkim kan hman atâna min petu Pathianah innghat zâwk tûrin fuih rawh .  
that they do good ,  that they be rich in good works ,  that they be ready to distribute ,  willing to communicate ; 	Thil ṭha ti tûr te ,  thil ṭha tiha hausa tûr te ,  phal taka mi dangte sem ve chîng tûr tein fuih bawk rawh . 
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come ,  that they may lay hold of eternal life . 	Tichuan ,  nakin atân ro hlu tak an insiamsak a ni ang a ,  nunna chu an chang dâwn nia .  
Timothy ,  guard that which is committed to you ,  turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called ; 	Aw Timothe ,  i kova innghat hi vawng fimkhur hle ang che ,   ‘ hriatna dik’ tia an chhâl ,  dik si lo ,  thu inkalh si ,  khawvêl mi tam takin an khûkpui ṭhin lakah khân inthiarfihlîm rawh ;

On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ;  and therein was found written ,  that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever , 	Mosia dân bu an han chhiar chuan Amon mite leh Moab mite chu Israel - ho zînga telh ve ngai loh tûr an nih thu a lo chuang reng mai a .  
because they didn ' t meet the children of Israel with bread and with water ,  but hired Balaam against them ,  to curse them :  however our God turned the curse into a blessing . 	Amon mite leh Moab mite hian ,  Israel - te Aigupta ram aṭanga an lo chhuah khân chaw leh tui in tûr takngial pawh an lo pe duh lovin
It came to pass ,  when they had heard the law ,  that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude . 	Israel - te ânchhe lawh tûrin Balaama an ruai zâwk a nih kha ;  mahse ,  Pathianin ânchhia chu malsâwmnaah a chantîr ta hlauh zâwk pawh a ni .  He dân hi Israel miten an hriat chuan an zîng aṭangin hnam dangte chu an thlauhthla ta a .  Siam ṭhat hna Nehemian a thawk 
Now before this ,  Eliashib the priest ,  who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God ,  being allied to Tobiah , 	Puithiam Eliasiba ,  Tempul kudâm enkawltu leh Tobia hi rei tak an lo inkâwmngeih tawh a .  
had prepared for him a great room ,  where before they laid the meal offerings ,  the frankincense ,  and the vessels ,  and the tithes of the grain ,  the new wine ,  and the oil ,  which were given by commandment to the Levites ,  and the singers ,  and the porters ;  and the wave offerings for the priests . 	Pindan zau tâwk tak pakhat ,  buh leh rimtui te ,  Tempula bungbêl hman tûr te ,  puithiamte tâna thilpêk te ,  buh te ,  uain te leh oliv hriak ,  sâwma pakhat ,  Levia chiten Tempul zaipâwl te leh Tempul pulis te tâna an pêk dahkhâwmna tûrah chuan Tobia chu a thlentîr ṭhîn a .  
But in all this  [ time ]  I was not at Jerusalem ;  for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king :  and after certain days asked I leave of the king , 	Chutianga a thlentîr ṭhin lai chuan kei chu Jerusalem - ah ka awm lo ;  Babulon - ah lal Artazerzia lal kum sawmthum leh pahnih kum chuan chanchin hrilh tûrin ka hâwng a ni .  Nakin deuhvah chuan kîr leh min phalsak a .  
and I came to Jerusalem ,  and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah ,  in preparing him a room in the courts of the house of God . 	Jerusalem - ah chuan ka haw leh ta a .  Eliasiban Tempul pindan pakhata Tobia a lo awmtîr ka hmuh chuan mak ka ti a . 
It grieved me severely :  therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the room . 	Ka thin a ur hle a ,  Tobia thawmhnaw chu ka theh chhuak a .  
Then I commanded ,  and they cleansed the rooms :  and there brought I again the vessels of the house of God ,  with the meal offerings and the frankincense . 	Pindan chu thian thianghlim tûrin thu ka pe a ,  Tempul bungbêl te ,  buhbâl thilpêk te ,  rimtui hâl tûrte dah kîr leh tûrin thu ka pe bawk a .  
I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them ;  so that the Levites and the singers ,  who did the work ,  had fled everyone to his field . 	Mipuiin ei tûr tâwk an pêk ṭhat loh avângin Tempul zaipâwl te leh Levia chi te chu an awmna ṭhin an in leh lovah an lo haw deuh vek tawh tih ka hre bawk a .  
Then I contended with the rulers ,  and said ,   " Why is the house of God forsaken  ?   "  I gathered them together ,  and set them in their place . 	Tempul an ngaihsak loh avângin hotute chu ka hau va ,  Levia chite leh zaipâwlte chu Tempulah ka ko kîr a ;  an hna an thawk ṭan leh ta a .  
Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries . 	Israel mi chuan an buh te ,  an uain te ,  an oliv hriak sâwma pakhat te chu tempulah an rawn keng leh ta bawk a .  
I made treasurers over the treasuries ,  Shelemiah the priest ,  and Zadok the scribe ,  and of the Levites ,  Pedaiah :  and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur ,  the son of Mattaniah ;  for they were counted faithful ,  and their business was to distribute to their brothers . 	Tempul kudâm enkawl tûr chuan hêng mite hi ka dah a :  Puithiam Selemia te ,  Dân thiam Zadoka te ,  Levia chi Pedaia te hi .  Anni puituah Zakura fapa Hanana ,  Matania tupa chu ka dah bawk a .  Anni hi an thawhpuite hnênah dik taka thil sem tûra ka rinte an ni .  
Remember me ,  my God ,  concerning this ,  and don ' t wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God ,  and for its observances . 	Aw ka Pathian ,  i Tempul rawngbâwlna atâna ka thiltihte hi hre reng ang che .  
In those days saw I in Judah some men treading winepresses on the Sabbath ,  and bringing in sheaves ,  and loading donkeys  [ therewith ]  ;  as also wine ,  grapes ,  and figs ,  and all kinds of burdens ,  which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day :  and I testified  [ against them ]  in the day in which they sold food . 	Chûng lai chuan Judai ramah mi ṭhenkhat chuan sabat niin grep an rap sâwr a ,  ṭhenkhatin sabengtungte chu Jerusalem - a zawrh tûrin buh te ,  uain te ,  oliv hriak te ,  sabat niah an phurhtîr a .  Chuvângin ,  sabat nia thil hralh chu kan khap ta a .  
There lived men of Tyre also therein ,  who brought in fish ,  and all kinds of wares ,  and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah ,  and in Jerusalem . 	Tura khaw mi ,  Jerusalem - a awmte chuan ,  sanghate leh thil dang chi Jerusalem khuaah sabat nia hralh tûr an rawn la ṭhîn a .  
Then I contended with the nobles of Judah ,  and said to them ,   " What evil thing is this that you do ,  and profane the Sabbath day  ?  	Juda hruaitute chu ka hau va ,    “  Thil sual tak in ti alâwm ,  sabat ni in bawhchhiat hi !  
Didn ' t your fathers do thus ,  and didn ' t our God bring all this evil on us ,  and on this city  ?   Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath .  " 	In thlahtuten hetianga sabat an bawhchhiat avângin alâwm a hrem che ua ,  khua hi a rawn tihchhiat kha !  Sabat ni bawhchhiain Israel - te chungah Pathian thinurna tihthlen belh in tum tlat a nih hi ! ” ka ti a .  
It came to pass that ,  when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath ,  I commanded that the doors should be shut ,  and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath .  I set some of my servants over the gates ,  that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day . 	Chuvângin ,  sabat ni a inṭan aṭangin khawpui kulh kawngkhâr chu ka khârtîr a ,  sabat ni a ral hma chu kawng hawng lo tûrin thu ka pe bawk a .  Sabat niin khawpuiah tu man eng mah an lâk luh theih loh nân kawngkhâr chu keima mite ngei ka vêntîr a .  
So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice . 	Ṭum hnih khat chu thil tinrêng rawn zuar ṭhînte chu khawpui kulh pâwnah Zirtâwpni zân chu an riak a .  
Then I testified against them ,  and said to them ,   " Why do you stay around the wall  ?   If you do so again ,  I will lay hands on you .  "  From that time on ,  they didn ' t come on the Sabbath . 	  “  Khatah riak tawh suh u ,  a sâwt lo ,  khatianga in tih leh chuan in chungah kut ka rawn thlâk tawh ang , ” ka ti a .  Chuta chin chu sabat niin an lo kal leh tawh ngai lo .  
I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves ,  and that they should come and keep the gates ,  to sanctify the Sabbath day .  Remember to me ,  my God ,  this also ,  and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness . 	Levia chite chu inthian thianghlim tûrin ka hrilh a ,  sabat ni chu serh ngei a nih theih nân kawngkhârahte chuan ka chântîr a .  Aw ka Pathian ,  hei vâng pawh hian min hre reng la ,  khawngaih takin min zuah ang che .  
In those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod ,  of Ammon ,   [ and ]  of Moab : 	Chutih lai chuan Juda pa tam tak chuan Asdod nula te ,  Amon nula te ,  Moab nula te nupuiah an nei tih ka hmu chhuak bawk a .  
and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod ,  and could not speak in the Jews '  language ,  but according to the language of each people . 	An fa zâtve dâwn lai chuan Asdod - ho ṭawng emaw ,  ṭawng dang emaw an hmang a ,  kan ṭawngin an ṭawng hlei thei lo .  
I contended with them ,  and cursed them ,  and struck certain of them ,  and plucked off their hair ,  and made them swear by God ,   [ saying ]  ,   " You shall not give your daughters to their sons ,  nor take their daughters for your sons ,  or for yourselves . 	Chûng mite chu ka hau va ,  ânchhia ka lawh a ,  a ṭhen phei chu ka vua a ,  an samte pawh ka pawhsak a .  Hnam dangte nên ,  an fate chen pawhin ,  inneih pawlh loh tûrin Pathian hming chhâlin chhia ka chhamtîr a .  
Didn ' t Solomon king of Israel sin by these things  ?   Yet among many nations was there no king like him ,  and he was beloved of his God ,  and God made him king over all Israel .  Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin . 	  “  Hnam dang hmeichhiaten alâwm lal Solomona pawh kha thil sual tihtîr .  Hnam dang lal aia ropui a ni a ,  Pathian pawhin a hmangaih a ,  Israel lalah a siam a ;  mahse ,  he thil sual hi a tih tâk kha .  
Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil ,  to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women  ?   " 	Pathian thu awih lovin hnam dang hmeichhia nangni angin kan nei ve mai dâwn em ni ang  ?  ” tiin ka chhâl a .  
One of the sons of Joiada ,  the son of Eliashib the high priest ,  was son - in - law to Sanballat the Horonite :  therefore I chased him from me . 	Puithiam lalber Eliasiba fapa Joiada chuan Sanbalata fanu nupuiah a nei a ,  ani chu Beth - horon mi a ni .  Jerusalem khua ata Joiada chu ka hnawt chhuak a .  
Remember them ,  my God ,  because they have defiled the priesthood ,  and the covenant of the priesthood ,  and of the Levites . 	Aw ka Pathian ,  hêng mite hian puithiam hming an tichhia a ,  puithiamte leh Levia chite nêna in thuthlung an bawhchhiat dân hi hre reng ang che .  
Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners ,  and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites ,  everyone in his work ; 	Hnam dangte nêna inhnamhnawihna ata mipui chu ka thian thianghlim a ,  puithiam leh Levia chite chu mahni tih tûr an hriat ṭheuh theih nân dân ka siamsak thlap a . 
and for the wood offering ,  at times appointed ,  and for the first fruits .  Remember me ,  my God ,  for good . 	Hâlral thilhlan hâlna tûr thingte chu a hun taka rawn keuh ziah tûrin hna ka sem a ,  mipui pawh buh thar hmasa leh thei hmin hmasa rawn ken hun tûr ka hrilh bawk a .  Aw ka Pathian ,  hêng hi hre reng la ,  ka thiltih ṭhatah min pawmsak ang che . 
Yet listen now ,  Jacob my servant ,  and Israel ,  whom I have chosen . 	Khai le ,  nang ka chhiahhlawh Jakob ,  Ka mi thlan Israel ,  ngaithla rawh le .  
This is what Yahweh who made you ,  and formed you from the womb ,  who will help you says :   " Don ' t be afraid ,  Jacob my servant ;  and you ,  Jeshurun ,  whom I have chosen . 	Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :  Siamtu che ka ni a ,  Pum chhûnga dintu che ka ni ,  Ka chhiahhlawh Jakob ,  ka pui ṭhîn che ,  Ka mi thlan ngei ,  Jesurun ,  hlau suh .  
For I will pour water on him who is thirsty ,  and streams on the dry ground .  I will pour my Spirit on your seed ,  and my blessing on your offspring : 	Ram rovah tui ka leih ang a ,  Ram chârah lui ka luantîr ang .  I thlahte chungah chuan Thlarau ka leih ang a ,  I tu leh fate chu mal ka sâwm ang . 
and they will spring up among the grass ,  as willows by the watercourses . 	Tui tamnaa hnimhring a duah ang leh ,  Tui luang kama tuipuisuthlah ang hian .  
One will say ,   ' I am Yahweh ' s ;  '  and another will be called by the name of Jacob ;  and another will write with his hand  ' to Yahweh ,  '  and honor the name of Israel .  " 	 ‘ Lalpa ta ngei ka ni , ’ miten an rawn ti thliah thliah ang ,  Jakoba hming an rawn ṭâwm ang a ,  A ṭhente chuan an bânah ,   ‘ Lalpa ta , ’ tih an ziak ang a ,  Ṭhenkhatte chuan Israela hming an pu bawk ang .  
This is what Yahweh ,  the King of Israel ,  and his Redeemer ,  Yahweh of Armies ,  says :   " I am the first ,  and I am the last ;  and besides me there is no God . 	Engkim Lalpa ,  Israel lal ,  anmahni tlantu ,  Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :   ‘ Kei hi a bul leh a tâwp ka ni ,  Keimah lo hi Pathian dang an awm lo .  
Who is like me  ?   Who will call ,  and will declare it ,  and set it in order for me ,  since I established the ancient people  ?   Let them declare the things that are coming ,  and that will happen . 	Keimah ang hi tu nge awm le  ?   Han sawi sela ,  rawn târlang chiang rawh se .  Hmânlai mite ka din an ni asin ,  Thil lo thleng tûr te leh Thil lo awm tûrte chu han puang teh se .  
Don ' t fear ,  neither be afraid .  Haven ' t I declared it to you long ago ,  and shown it  ?   You are my witnesses .  Is there a God besides me  ?   Indeed ,  there is not .  I don ' t know any other Rock .  " 	Hlau hauh suh la ,  thlabâr hek suh ,  Hmân aṭanga ka sawi lâwk kha in hre lâwm ni  ?   Ka thuhretu in ni ,  Keimah lo hi Pathian dang an awm em  ?   Ka hriat ve loh pathian ropui an awm em ni  ?  ” 
Everyone who makes an engraved image is vain .  The things that they delight in will not profit .  Their own witnesses don ' t see ,  nor know ,  that they may be disappointed . 	Milem siamtute hi eng mah an ni hlawm lo ,  an thil siam ,  an hlut êm êmte lah a ṭangkai hek lo .  Hêng betute hian eng mah an hre fiah thei lo va ,  an hre thei hek lo ,  an la zak ang . 
Who has fashioned a god ,  or molds an image that is profitable for nothing  ?  	Pathian lem siama ,  milem chhûng ṭhînte hian ṭangkaipui loh an inring ngai em ni  ?  
Behold ,  all his fellows will be disappointed ;  and the workmen are mere men .  Let them all be gathered together .  Let them stand up .  They will fear .  They will be put to shame together . 	Chûng betu chu an la mualpho vek ang .  Mi themthiamte hi mihring mai bawk an ni si a ,  lo kal khâwm sela ,  ka hmaah lo ding teh se ,  an khûr ang a ,  an mualpho hle ang .  
The blacksmith takes an axe ,  works in the coals ,  fashions it with hammers ,  and works it with his strong arm .  He is hungry ,  and his strength fails ;  he drinks no water ,  and is faint . 	Thîrdêngin meilinga rawhin hriam a chher a ,  tubohvin a dêng a ,  theihtâwpin a ṭang a .  A rilte a ṭâm a ,  a lo hah a ,  tuihâlin a chau hle ṭhîn .  
The carpenter stretches out a line .  He marks it out with a pencil .  He shapes it with planes .  He marks it out with compasses ,  and shapes it like the figure of a man ,  with the beauty of a man ,  to reside in a house . 	Mistiri - in thing chu a han teh a ,  a rîn kual a ,  hriamin a riruang chu a han duang a ,  mihring lemah a chhuah ta a .  A in chhûnga dah atân mihring lem mawi tak a siam ta a . 
He cuts down cedars for himself ,  and takes the cypress and the oak ,  and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest .  He plants a fir tree ,  and the rain nourishes it . 	Ngâw aṭangin sidar thing emaw ,  fâr thing emaw ,  sasua emaw a va kit a ;  a nih loh leh ruah châwm len sidar thing phun chu a kit a .  
Then it will be for a man to burn ;  and he takes some of it ,  and warms himself .  Yes ,  he burns it ,  and bakes bread .  Yes ,  he makes a god ,  and worships it ;  he makes it an engraved image ,  and falls down to it . 	A ṭhen chu thingah a tuah a ,  a lum a ai a .  A lingin chhang a ur a ,  a ṭhen erawh chu milem siam nân a hmang a ,  chibai a bûk ta a .  
He burns part of it in the fire .  With part of it ,  he eats meat .  He roasts a roast ,  and is satisfied .  Yes ,  he warms himself ,  and says ,   " Aha !  I am warm .  I have seen the fire .  " 	A ṭhen chu thingah a hmang a ,  sa a rawh a ,  a ei puar a ,  mei lum chu a ai a ,    “  A lum hle e ,  a alh duh hle mai , ” a ti a .  
The rest of it he makes into a god ,  even his engraved image .  He bows down to it and worships ,  and prays to it ,  and says ,   " Deliver me ;  for you are my god !  " 	Thing bung dang chuan milem a siam a ,  a kûn a ,  chibai a bûk ta a .  A hnênah a ṭawngṭai a ,    “  Ka pathian i ni e ,  min chhandam rawh , ” a ti a .  
They don ' t know ,  neither do they consider :  for he has shut their eyes ,  that they can ' t see ;  and their hearts ,  that they can ' t understand . 	Chutiang mi chu an mâwl lutuk e ,  eng mah an hre lo a ni .  Hmuh hlauvin an maimitchhîng a ,  hriat hlauvin an rilru an hawng duh lo .  
No one thinks ,  neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say ,   " I have burned part of it in the fire .  Yes ,  I have also baked bread on its coals .  I have roasted meat and eaten it .  Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination  ?   Shall I bow down to a tree trunk  ?   " 	  “  A ṭhen chu thingtuahah ka hmang a ,  chhang ka ur a ,  sa ka rawh a ,  ka ei a ;  a ṭhen chuan milem ka siam a ,  thingtum hmaa kûnin chibai ka lo bûk a nih hi , ” tih nachâng hria rêng an awm lo va ,  hmu thiam an awm hek lo .  
He feeds on ashes .  A deceived heart has turned him aside ;  and he can ' t deliver his soul ,  nor say ,   " Isn ' t there a lie in my right hand  ?   " 	Vaivut ei ang chauhva sâwt lo va ni .  A ngaih dân â tak chuan a hruai bo va ,  chhan chhuah rual a ni tawh lo ,    “  Ka milem ken hi eng mah a lo ni lo , ” tih nachâng rêng a hre thei lo .  
Remember these things ,  Jacob and Israel ;  for you are my servant .  I have formed you .  You are my servant .  Israel ,  you will not be forgotten by me . 	Jakob ,  hêng hi hre reng ang che ,  Israel ,  nang hi zawng ka chhiahhlawh i nih hi ,  Ka chhiahhlawhah ka siam che a ,  Aw Israel ,  ka theihnghilh ngai lo vang che .  
I have blotted out ,  as a thick cloud ,  your transgressions ,  and ,  as a cloud ,  your sins .  Return to me ,  for I have redeemed you . 	Thli len bo chhûm angin i bawhchhiatna ka lên bo va ,  Ṭiauchhûm a ral angin i sualnate a ral ta e .  Ka hnênah lo kîr rawh ,  i tlantu chu ka ni .  
Sing ,  you heavens ,  for Yahweh has done it !  Shout ,  you lower parts of the earth !  Break out into singing ,  you mountains ,  O forest ,  all of your trees ,  for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob ,  and will glorify himself in Israel .

Jakoba chu Lalpan a tlan chhuak a ,  Israel - te zîngah a inchawimawi ta e .  
Thus says Yahweh ,  your Redeemer ,  and he who formed you from the womb :   " I am Yahweh ,  who makes all things ;  who alone stretches out the heavens ;  who spreads out the earth by myself ; 	Pum chhûnga siamtu che ,  nangmah tlantu ,  Lalpa chuan heti hian a ti :    “  Engkim siamtu ,  kei hi Lalpa chu ka ni a ,  Mahni maia vân khi kai pharhtu chu ka ni ,  Lei hi ka siam lai khân tu nge tel ve  ?   
who frustrates the signs of the liars ,  and makes diviners mad ;  who turns wise men backward ,  and makes their knowledge foolish ; 	Zâwlnei derte thu ka tihlawhchham ṭhîn a ,  Aienthiamte ka timualpho bawk ṭhîn .  Mi fingte chu ka let thla a ,  An hriatna âtthlâkzia ka târlang ṭhîn .  
who confirms the word of his servant ,  and performs the counsel of his messengers ;  who says of Jerusalem ,   ' She will be inhabited ;  '  and of the cities of Judah ,   ' They will be built ,  '  and  ' I will raise up its waste places ;  ' 	Ka chhiahhlawhte thu ka nemnghet a ,  Ka tirhkohte remruat ka tipuitling zêl ṭhîn .   ‘ Jerusalem khua chu an luah leh ang a ,  Judai ram khuate pawh an din leh ang ,  a chhiate pawh ka siam ṭha ang , ’ ka ti a ni .  
who says to the deep ,   ' Be dry ,  '  and  ' I will dry up your rivers ;  ' 	Tuifinriat chu kang chat tûrin thu ka pe a ,  A tuite chu a kang ta a .  
Who says of Cyrus ,   ' He is my shepherd ,  and shall perform all my pleasure ,  '  even saying of Jerusalem ,   ' She will be built ;  '  and of the temple ,   ' Your foundation will be laid .  '  " 	Kura hnênah chuan ,   ‘ Ka berâmpu i ni ,  ka thiltum chu tihlawhtling rawh ,  Jerusalem sak ṭhattîr la ,  Tempul sak nân lung phûmtîr rawh , ’ ka ti bawk a . ” 
When I came to you ,  brothers ,  I didn ' t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom ,  proclaiming to you the testimony of God . 	Kei zawng unaute u ,  Pathian thu ril puang tûra in hnêna ka lo kal khân ,  thu thiam bîk leh fing bîk angin ka lo kal loh kha .  
For I determined not to know anything among you ,  except Jesus Christ ,  and him crucified . 	In zînga ka awm chhûngin Isua Krista leh Krawsa khenbeh a nih thu chauh lo chu eng dang mah hria nih ka tum loh kha .  
I was with you in weakness ,  in fear ,  and in much trembling . 	In zîngah chak lo takin ,  hlau leh khûr chungin ka awm a ,  
My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom ,  but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power , 	ka thu sawiah leh thu hrilah thu sawi tlawr leh thu fing hmang lovin ,  Thlarau leh a thiltihtheihna tilang zâwngin ka sawi zâwk ṭhîn a ni ;  
that your faith wouldn ' t stand in the wisdom of men ,  but in the power of God . 	mihring finnaa innghat lova ,  Pathian thiltihtheihnaa in innghah zâwk nân .  
We speak wisdom ,  however ,  among those who are full grown ;  yet a wisdom not of this world ,  nor of the rulers of this world ,  who are coming to nothing . 	Puitling zîngah zawng thu fing kan sawi ṭhîn ,  tûnlai mite finna hi a ni lo va ,  an hotu ,  tlâwm mai tûrte finna lah a ni bawk hek lo .  
But we speak God ' s wisdom in a mystery ,  the wisdom that has been hidden ,  which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory , 	Thu fing inthup kan sawi hi Pathian thu ril ,  kan ropuina tûra leilung pian hmaa Pathianin a lo ruat lâwk tawh chu a ni .  
which none of the rulers of this world has known .  For had they known it ,  they wouldn ' t have crucified the Lord of glory . 	Chu chu he khawvêl rorêltu tu mahin an hre lo ,  hria sela ropuina Lalpa chu an khêngbet lo tûr .  
But as it is written ,   " Things which an eye didn ' t see ,  and an ear didn ' t hear ,  which didn ' t enter into the heart of man ,  these God has prepared for those who love him .  " 	Lehkha Thu - in :    “  Mita la hmuh ngai loh ,  benga la hriat ngai loh ,  Mihring rilrua lût ngai lo ,  amah hmangaihtute tâna Pathianin a buatsaihsak chu , ” a tih kha kan hril zâwk a ni .  
But to us ,  God revealed them through the Spirit .  For the Spirit searches all things ,  yes ,  the deep things of God . 	Chûng chu kan hnênah Pathianin Thlarauvin a rawn puang ta a ;  a ni ,  Thlarau chuan engkim ,  Pathian rilru thûk pawh a hre vek a .  
For who among men knows the things of a man ,  except the spirit of the man ,  which is in him  ?   Even so ,  no one knows the things of God ,  except God ' s Spirit . 	Mihring rilru chhûngril chu amaha awm thlarau chauh lo chuan tuin nge hria  ?   Chutiang bawkin Pathian rilru chhûngril pawh Pathian Thlarau ngawt lo chuan tu man an hre lo .  
But we received ,  not the spirit of the world ,  but the Spirit which is from God ,  that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God . 	Khawvêl thlarau kan dawng lo va ,  Pathian Thlarau ,  Pathian hnêna mi kan dawng zâwk a ni ,  Pathian thilthlâwnpêkte kan hriat theih nân .  
Which things also we speak ,  not in words which man ' s wisdom teaches ,  but which the Holy Spirit teaches ,  comparing spiritual things with spiritual things . 	Mihring finna an inzirtîr ṭhin chu hmang lovin ,  Thlarau zirtîrna hmangin thu kan sawi zâwk a ,  thlarau mite hnênah thlarau lam thil kan sawi fiah ṭhîn .  
Now the natural man doesn ' t receive the things of God ' s Spirit ,  for they are foolishness to him ,  and he can ' t know them ,  because they are spiritually discerned . 	Tisa mi chuan Pathian Thlarau lam thil eng mah a lâwm lo ,  a tân chuan âtthlâk mai a ni ,  thlarau chauhva hriat theih a nih avângin a hre thei lo .  
But he who is spiritual discerns all things ,  and he himself is judged by no one . 	Thlarau mi erawh chuan thil engkim a thliar thiam a ;  ani lah chu tu man an hrethiam pha si lo .  
 " For who has known the mind of the Lord ,  that he should instruct him  ?   "  But we have Christ ' s mind . 	Lalpa rilru chu tu nge hriaa ,  amah chu zirtîr thei  ?   Keini zawngin Krista rilru kan pu a ni . 
Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem :  and they killed the Passover on the fourteenth  [ day ]  of the first month . 	al Josia chuan Lalpa hmingin Jerusalem - ah Kalhlên kût a hmang a .  Thla khatna ,  ni sâwm leh pali ni chuan kûtna tûr ran a talh a .  
He set the priests in their offices ,  and encouraged them to the service of the house of Yahweh . 	Puithiamho chu Tempula an thawh tûr hna a sem a ,  ṭha taka thawk tûrin a fuih a ,  
He said to the Levites who taught all Israel ,  who were holy to Yahweh ,   " Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built .  There shall no more be a burden on your shoulders .  Now serve Yahweh your God ,  and his people Israel . 	Lalpa tâna serh hran ,  Dân zirtîrtu Levia chite pawh hetiang hian a hrilh a :    “  Davida fapa Solomona in sak chhûngah Thuthlung Bâwm hi dah rawh u ,  zâwn sawn chhên a ngai tawh lo .  In Pathian ,  Lalpa leh a mi Israel - te rawng in bâwl tûr a ni .  
Prepare yourselves after your fathers '  houses by your divisions ,  according to the writing of David king of Israel ,  and according to the writing of Solomon his son . 	A chi chi - in Tempula in awmna tûrah awm ula ,  in tih tûr lal Davida leh a fapa Solomonan an ruat ang kha ti ang che u .  
Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers '  houses of your brothers the children of the people ,  and  [ let there be for each ]  a portion of a fathers '  house of the Levites . 	Hna in insem hunah Israel chhûngkawho ṭanpuitu tûr Levia mite ruat ṭhîn ang che u .  
Kill the Passover ,  and sanctify yourselves ,  and prepare for your brothers ,  to do according to the word of Yahweh by Moses .  " 	Kalhlên Kût sa tûr berâm leh kêl in talh tûr a ni .  Tûnah inthian thianghlim rawh u ,  an thilhlan tûrte hlanpui ula ,  Mosia hnêna Lalpa thupêk ang kha in unau Israel - te chuan an zawm theih nân , ” a ti a .  
Josiah gave to the children of the people ,  of the flock ,  lambs and young goats ,  all of them for the Passover offerings ,  to all who were present ,  to the number of thirty thousand ,  and three thousand bulls :  these were of the king ' s substance . 	Kalhlên Kûta mipui hman atân Josia chuan ama ran rual zînga mi ngei berâm te ,  berâmno te leh keltê sîngthum ,  bâwngpa sângthum a thawh a .  
His princes gave for a freewill offering to the people ,  to the priests ,  and to the Levites .  Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel ,  the rulers of the house of God ,  gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred  [ small livestock ]  ,  and three hundred head of cattle . 	A miliante pawh chuan mipui te ,  puithiam te leh Levia chi te ei tûr an thawh bawk a .  Tempul hotu puithiam lalber Hilkia te ,  Zekaria te leh Jehiela te chuan berâmno leh keltê sanghnih leh zaruk leh bâwngpa zathum ,  kût chhûnga thilhlana an hlan tûrin puithiamte chu an pe a .  
Conaniah also ,  and Shemaiah and Nethanel ,  his brothers ,  and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad ,  the chiefs of the Levites ,  gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand  [ small livestock ]  ,  and five hundred head of cattle . 	Levia chi hotu Konania te ,  Semaia te leh a unau Nethanela te ,  Hasabia te ,  Jeiela te ,  Jozabada te chuan berâmno leh keltê sângnga leh bâwngpa zanga ,  Levia chiten thilhlana an hman tûr an thawh bawk a .  
So the service was prepared ,  and the priests stood in their place ,  and the Levites by their divisions ,  according to the king ' s commandment . 	Kalhlên Kût hmanna tûr engkim an tihfel hnu chuan lal thu angin puithiamte leh Levia chite chu an hmun ṭheuh tûrah an awm a .  
They killed the Passover ,  and the priests sprinkled  [ the blood which they received ]  of their hand ,  and the Levites flayed them . 	Kêl leh berâm an talh zawh chuan Levia chite chuan a vun an lip a ,  puithiamten a thisen chu maichâmah an theh a .  
They removed the burnt offerings ,  that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers '  houses of the children of the people ,  to offer to Yahweh ,  as it is written in the book of Moses .  So did they with the cattle . 	Hâlral thilhlana hman tûr chu chhûng tin tân Mosia Dân bu - a ziak anga an hlan tûrin an sem a .  
They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance :  and the holy offerings boiled they in pots ,  and in caldrons ,  and in pans ,  and carried them quickly to all the children of the people . 	Levia chite chuan Dân angin Kalhlên kût sa chu an hem hmin a ,  sa thianghlim ṭhenkhat chu bêlah te ,  thîrbêlah te ,  bêlpuiah te an chhûm a ,  a sa chu mipui an sem a .  
Afterward they prepared for themselves ,  and for the priests ,  because the priests the sons of Aaron  [ were busied ]  in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night :  therefore the Levites prepared for themselves ,  and for the priests the sons of Aaron . 	Chumi hnu chuan anmahni leh Arona thlah puithiamte ei tûr sa an siam leh a ,  puithiamho khân hâlral thilhlan leh an thilhlan thau hâlna mei chu an vil zânkhua si a .  
The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place ,  according to the commandment of David ,  and Asaph ,  and Heman ,  and Jeduthun the king ' s seer ;  and the porters were at every gate :  they didn ' t need to depart from their service ;  for their brothers the Levites prepared for them . 	Lal Davida thupêk angin Asafa te ,  Hemana te leh lal zâwlnei Jeduthuna te chuan thil tum mi Asafa thlahte chu an awmna hmun tûrah an awmtîr a .  Tempul vêngtute tân pawh kal sawn a ngai lo ,  an ṭhian Levia chi ,  mi dangte khân Kalhlên Kût sa chu an lo buatsaihsak a ni .  
So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day ,  to keep the Passover ,  and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh ,  according to the commandment of king Josiah . 	Lal Josia thu ang chuan Lalpa chu an bia a ,  tih tûr Kalhlên Kût hman te ,  maichâma hâlral thilhlan hlan te chu an ti a .  
The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time ,  and the feast of unleavened bread seven days . 	Ni ruk chhûng ,  Kalhlên Kût leh chhang dawidim telh loh kût chu Israel mi zawng zawngin an hmang a . 
There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet ;  neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept ,  and the priests ,  and the Levites ,  and all Judah and Israel who were present ,  and the inhabitants of Jerusalem . 	Zâwlnei Samuela thih hnu kha chuan heti taka ropui hian Kalhlên Kût an hmang ngai lo .  Lal Josia te ,  puithiam te ,  Levia chi te ,  Juda leh Israel rama awmte leh Jerusalem - a awmten Kalhlên Kût an hman ang hian an la hmang ngai lo .  
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept . 	Lal Josia kum sâwm leh pariat a lal kum khân an hmang a ni . 
After all this ,  when Josiah had prepared the temple ,  Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates :  and Josiah went out against him . 	Lal Josian heti taka Tempul a chei hnu hian Aigupta lal Nekoa chuan Eufretis lui kamah ,  Karkhemis - ah ,  indo tûrin a sipaite a hruai a .  Josia chuan lo dan a tum a .  
But he sent ambassadors to him ,  saying ,   " What have I to do with you ,  you king of Judah  ?   I come not against you this day ,  but against the house with which I have war .  God has commanded me to make haste .  Beware that it is God who is with me ,  that he not destroy you .  " 	Nekoa chuan ,    “  Nang Juda lal ,  he thilah hian i lo inrawlhna tûr a awm lo .  Nang bei tûr chein ka lo kal lo ,  ka hmêlma bei tûra lo kal ka ni .  Pathian chuan hmanhmawh tûrin min ti a ni ,  ka lamṭang a ni a ,  mi lo dan tum teh suh ,  a tichhe palh ang che , ” tiin palai a rawn tîr a .  
Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him ,  but disguised himself ,  that he might fight with him ,  and didn ' t listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God ,  and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo . 	Josia chuan lo beih chu a tum ta tlat a ,  Nekoa hmanga Pathian thu sawi chu a awih duh lo va ,  a inchei danglam a ,  Megido phaia an inbeihnaah chuan a kal ve ta a .  
The archers shot at king Josiah ;  and the king said to his servants ,   " Take me away ,  because I am seriously wounded !  " 	An inbeih lai chuan Aigupta sipai thal chuan Josia chu a fuh ta a .  A tawlailîr khalhtu hnênah ,    “  Min hliam na hle mai ,  indona hmun ata hi min chhuahpui rawh , ” a ti a .  
So his servants took him out of the chariot ,  and put him in the second chariot that he had ,  and brought him to Jerusalem ;  and he died ,  and was buried in the tombs of his fathers .  All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah . 	Ama tawlailîr ata chu an zâwn chhuak a ,  tawlailîr dang a hruaiah chuan an dah a ;  Jerusalem - ah an hâwn ta a .  A thi a ,  lal thlânah an phûm a ,  Judai ram leh Jerusalem mite chuan an ui a ,  an sûn a .  
Jeremiah lamented for Josiah :  and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day ;  and they made them an ordinance in Israel :  and behold ,  they are written in the lamentations . 	Zâwlnei Jeremia chuan Josia sûnna hla a phuah a ,  Israel zîngah chuan hla sa mi ,  mipa leh hmeichhiaten lal sûn hlaah an sa ṭhîn .  Sûnna hla ziak khâwmna bu - ah chu hla chu a chuang .  
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah ,  and his good deeds ,  according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh , 	Josia thil tih Lalpa a ngainatzia te ,  Dân thu a awihzia te ,  
and his acts ,  first and last ,  behold ,  they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah . 	a bul aṭanga a tâwp thleng chanchin chu Israel leh Juda lalte chanchin ziakna bu - ah a chuang vek a ni . 
Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh ,  his God ,  out of the fish ' s belly . 	ona chu sangha kawchhûng aṭang chuan a Pathian ,  Lalpa hnênah heti hian a ṭawngṭai a :  
He said ,   " I called because of my affliction to Yahweh .  He answered me .  Out of the belly of Sheol I cried .  You heard my voice . 	  “  Ka mangan tâwpah Lalpa ka ko va ,  Anin min chhâng a ,  Seol aṭangin ka au va ,  Nangin ka aw i lo hre ta .  
For you threw me into the depths ,  in the heart of the seas .  The flood was all around me .  All your waves and your billows passed over me . 	Tuifinriat mawng ,  a thûk laiah Nangin min paih lût a ,  Tuite chuan min khuh hlup hlup a ,  I tuifâwnte leh tui inchhawkte chuan min vûr ta .  
I said ,   ' I have been banished from your sight ;  yet I will look again toward your holy temple .  ' 	Kei chuan ,   ‘ I hnên ata min hnawt chhuak a ,  I in thianghlim ka hmu dâwn tawh lo a nih hi , ’ Ka lo ti a .  
The waters surrounded me ,  even to the soul .  The deep was around me .  The weeds were wrapped around my head . 	Tuite chuan min chîm pil a ,  Ka vêlin tuithûkpui chuan min hual a ,  Tuifinriat hnimte chuan ka lu a phuar a .  
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains .  The earth barred me in forever :  yet have you brought up my life from the pit ,  Yahweh my God . 	Tlâng innghahnaahte ka tla lût a ,  Lei hnuai khura tâng reng tûrin .  Mahse ,  aw Lalpa ,  ka Pathian ,  Nangin khur thûk ata chu min la chhuak ta .  
 " When my soul fainted within me ,  I remembered Yahweh .  My prayer came in to you ,  into your holy temple . 	Thi mai dâwna ka inhriat lai khân Lalpa chu ka hre reng a ,  Ka ṭawngṭaina chu i biak in thianghlimah I hnên a lo thleng ta .  
Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy . 	Eng mah ni lo milem betute chu I lakah an rinawm ta lo va ni .  
But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving .  I will pay that which I have vowed .  Salvation belongs to Yahweh .  " 	Kei erawh chuan fak hla sa - in Inthawina ka hlân ang che ,  Ka thutiam chu ka hlen ang ,  Chhandamtu chu Lalpa a ni si a , ” tiin .  
Yahweh spoke to the fish ,  and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land . 	Tichuan ,  Lalpa chuan sangha chu thu a pe a ,  khawmualah Jona chu a law chhuak ta a . 
Meanwhile ,  when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together ,  so much so that they trampled on each other ,  he began to tell his disciples first of all ,   " Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees ,  which is hypocrisy . 	Chutih chhûng chuan mipui sâng tam tak inrap nûlh nûlh khawp an lo pung khâwm a ,  ani chuan thu a sawi a ,  a zirtîrte hnênah phei chuan ,    “  Farisai - te dawidim vervêkna lakah chuan fîmkhur rawh u .  
But there is nothing covered up ,  that will not be revealed ,  nor hidden ,  that will not be known . 	Eng mah thup hlen theih a ni lo ,  a lang leh mai ṭhîn ;  eng mah zêp hlen theih a ni hek lo ,  hriat chhuah a ni leh mai ṭhîn .  
Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light .  What you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops . 	Zân thima sawi chu a tûk êngah miin an hria ang ,  pindan chhûngrila in sawi rûk chu in chunga chuangin an tlângaupui ang . 
 " I tell you ,  my friends ,  don ' t be afraid of those who kill the body ,  and after that have no more that they can do . 	  “  Ka ṭhiante u ,  ka hrilh a che u ,  taksa tihluma ,  chumi hnua eng mah tih thei tawh lo che u chu hlau suh u .  
But I will warn you whom you should fear .  Fear him ,  who after he has killed ,  has power to cast into Gehenna .  Yes ,  I tell you ,  fear him . 	Tu nge hlauh tûr ka hrilh ang che u ;  taksa tihluma ,  chumi hnu pawha hremhmuna paih theitu che u chu hlau rawh u ;  a ni ,  ka hrilh a che u ,  amah mawlh chu hlau rawh u .  
 " Aren ' t five sparrows sold for two assaria coins  ?   Not one of them is forgotten by God . 	Chawngzawng panga pawisa pahnihin an hralh ṭhîn lo vem ni  ?   Pathian erawh chuan an zînga pakhat tê mah a hmaih ngai lo .  In samzaite lam pawh a chhiar vek asin .  
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .  Therefore don ' t be afraid .  You are of more value than many sparrows . 	Hlau suh u ,  chawngzawng tam tak aiin in hlu zâwk e . 
 " I tell you ,  everyone who confesses me before men ,  him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God ; 	  “  Ka hrilh a che u ,  mite hmaa mi ṭan apiang chu Pathian vântirhkohte hmaah Mihring Fapa hian a ṭan ve ang . 
but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God . 	Nimahsela ,  mite hmaa mi phat chu Pathian vântirhkohte hmaah a phat ve ang .  
Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven ,  but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven . 	Tin ,  Mihring Fapa chu an sawisêl pawhin an sawisêlna chu ngaihdam a ni ang ;  amaherawhchu ,  Thlarau Thianghlim meuh pawi sawi chu ngaihdam a ni lo vang .  
When they bring you before the synagogues ,  the rulers ,  and the authorities ,  don ' t be anxious how or what you will answer ,  or what you will say ; 	  “  Tin ,  sunagog hotute leh thuneitute hmaa an hruai hunah che u chuan ,  chhân dân tûr emaw ,  in sawi tûr emaw engto suh ang che u ,  
for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say .  " 	a hun takah Thlarau Thianghlim chuan in sawi tûr a hrilh dâwn che u a ni , ” a ti a . 
One of the multitude said to him ,   " Teacher ,  tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me .  " 	Mipui zînga pakhat chuan ,    “  Zirtîrtu ,  ka unaupa hnênah ka pa ro mi sem ve tûrin mi hrilhsak rawh , ” a ti a .  
But he said to him ,   " Man ,  who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you  ?   " 	Ani chuan ,    “  Mihring ,  nangni tân rorêltuah leh ro semtuah tu nge mi siam  ?  ” a ti a .  
He said to them ,   " Beware !  Keep yourselves from covetousness ,  for a man ' s life doesn ' t consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses .  " 	Tin ,  an hnênah ,    “  Fîmkhur ula ,  awhna rêng rêng lakah invêng rawh u ;  mihring nunna hi a hausaknaah a innghat lo ve , ” a ti a . 
He spoke a parable to them ,  saying ,   " The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly . 	An hnênah tehkhin thu a sawi a :    “  Mi hausa tak pakhat hi a lo a hlâwk êm êm a .  
He reasoned within himself ,  saying ,   ' What will I do ,  because I don ' t have room to store my crops  ?   ' 	Tichuan ,  a inngaihtuah a ,   ‘ Engtin nge ka tih tâk ang  ?   Ka buh leh bâl dah khâwmna ka nei sêng ta si lo , ’ a ti a .  
He said ,   ' This is what I will do .  I will pull down my barns ,  and build bigger ones ,  and there I will store all my grain and my goods . 	 ‘ Heti hian ka ti teh ang ;  ka buh inte ka ṭhiat ang a ,  a aia lianin ka sa ang a ;  chutah chuan ka buh leh bâl leh ka sum zawng zawng ka chhêk khâwm ang .  
I will tell my soul ,   " Soul ,  you have many goods laid up for many years .  Take your ease ,  eat ,  drink ,  be merry .  "  ' 	Tin ,   ‘ Pa vânnei !  Kum rei tak daih sum tam tak i khâwl tâk hi ;  châwl la ,  eiin bâr la ,  nuam takin awm rawh ,  ka ti ang , ’ a ti a .  
 " But God said to him ,   ' You foolish one ,  tonight your soul is required of you .  The things which you have prepared -  - whose will they be  ?   ' 	Nimahsela ,  Pathianin a hnênah ,   ‘ Mi â ,  zânin hian i nun an lâksak dâwn che a ni .  I thil deh chhuahte kha tuten nge nei ta ang  ?  ’ a ti a .  
So is he who lays up treasure for himself ,  and is not rich toward God .  " 	Mahni tâna sum khâwla ,  Pathian lama ngah si lo chu ,  chuti mai chu a ni , ” a ti a . 
He said to his disciples ,   " Therefore I tell you ,  don ' t be anxious for your life ,  what you will eat ,  nor yet for your body ,  what you will wear . 	A zirtîrte hnênah chuan ,    “  Chuvângin ,  ka hrilh a che u ,  nun nân eng nge in ei anga ,  in taksa tân eng nge in sin ang tih lungkham suh u .  
Life is more than food ,  and the body is more than clothing . 	Ei tûr aiin nunna a pawimawh zâwk a ,  silhfên aiin taksa a pawimawh zâwk bawk .  
Consider the ravens :  they don ' t sow ,  they don ' t reap ,  they have no warehouse or barn ,  and God feeds them .  How much more valuable are you than birds ! 	Choakte hi ngaihtuah teh mah u ,  buh an tuh lo va ,  an seng hek lo ,  zêm an nei lo va ,  buh in pawh an nei hek lo ;  nimahsela ,  Pathianin a châwm ṭhîn ;  nangni hi savate ai chuan in hlu zâwk daih a ni .  
Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height  ?  	Nangni zîngah lungkham avângin tu nge mahni nun tisei hret thei 
If then you aren ' t able to do even the least things ,  why are you anxious about the rest  ?  	Hemi tê pawh ti thei si lo ,  engati nge thil dang in lungkham  ?  
Consider the lilies ,  how they grow .  They don ' t toil ,  neither do they spin ;  yet I tell you ,  even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these . 	  “  Tûktinpâr ṭhan dânte hi ngaihtuah teh u ,  hna an thawk lo va ,  la an dek hek lo ;  nimahsela ,  ka hrilh a che u ,  Solomona meuh pawh a ropui thei ang bera a inthuam khân ,  hêng tûktinpâr pakhat tluk pawh hian chei a ni lo .  
But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field ,  which today exists ,  and tomorrow is cast into the oven ,  how much more will he clothe you ,  O you of little faith  ?  	Chutichuan ,  ram hnim ,  vawiina nung ,  a tûka meia tuah leh mai tûr mah Pathianin chuti kauva a chei si chuan ,  aw nangni ,  rin tlêmte u ,  chûngte ai chuan a va thuam nasa zâwk dâwn che u êm !  
Don ' t seek what you will eat or what you will drink ;  neither be anxious . 	Nangni zawng ,  ei leh in tûr ngaihtuahin buai phili suh ula ,  mangang hek suh u .  
For the nations of the world seek after all of these things ,  but your Father knows that you need these things . 	Hêng hi khawvêl mi zawng zawng buaipui ber a ni ;  in Pain hêngte hi nangni pawhin in mamawh ve tho tih a hria e .  
But seek God ' s Kingdom ,  and all these things will be added to you . 	Ama ram chu zawng zâwk ula ,  tichuan ,  hêngte pawh hi a pêk belhchhah dâwn che u nia .  
Don ' t be afraid ,  little flock ,  for it is your Father ' s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom . 	Pâwl tlêmte u ,  hlau suh u ,  ram pêk che u hi in Pa lâwmzâwng tak a ni e . 
Sell that which you have ,  and give gifts to the needy .  Make for yourselves purses which don ' t grow old ,  a treasure in the heavens that doesn ' t fail ,  where no thief approaches ,  neither moth destroys . 	  “  In neih apiang hralh ula ,  pachhiate pe rawh u ,  vânah ,  rûkru kal lohnaah ,  thîm ei theih lohnaah chuan ,  tangka ip phai thei lo te ,  sum ral thei lo te insiam rawh u .  
For where your treasure is ,  there will your heart be also . 	In ro awmna apiangah in rilru pawh a awm ṭhin hi . 
 " Let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning . 	  “  Insiam sa diamin ,  khâwnvâr chhit sa nên inpeih reng rawh u .  
Be like men watching for their lord ,  when he returns from the marriage feast ;  that ,  when he comes and knocks ,  they may immediately open to him . 	An pu lawichaw ei hawin kawngkhâr a rawn kik lo hawn vat thei tûra nghâk rengte ang hian awm rawh u .  
Blessed are those servants ,  whom the lord will find watching when he comes .  Most certainly I tell you ,  that he will dress himself ,  and make them recline ,  and will come and serve them . 	An pu lo hâwngin amah lo nghâk rengtu bawih a rawn hmuh chu an nihlawh e .  Thu dik ka hrilh a che u ,  ani chu a insiam ang a ,  anni chu chaw a kîltîr ang a ,  an chaw ei a vil ang . 
They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch ,  and finds them so . 	Zânlaiah emaw ,  khawvâr lamah emaw a lo hâwna ,  chutianga bawih a rawn hmuhte chu an nihlawh e .  
But know this ,  that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming ,  he would have watched ,  and not allowed his house to be broken into . 	Hei hi in hria e ,  rûkru lo kal hun tûr in neituin hria sela ,  a vêng ang a ,  a in a reh pawhtîr lo vang .  
Therefore be ready also ,  for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don ' t expect him .  " 	Nangni pawh inpeih rengin awm rawh u ,  Mihring Fapa chu in beisei loh hunah a lo kal hlauh dah ang e , ” a ti a . 
Peter said to him ,   " Lord ,  are you telling this parable to us ,  or to everybody  ?   " 	Petera chuan ,    “  Lalpa ,  he tehkhin thu hi keimahni chauh nge min hrilh mi zawng zawng  ?  ” a ti a . 
The Lord said ,   " Who then is the faithful and wise steward ,  whom his lord will set over his household ,  to give them their portion of food at the right times  ?  	Lalpa chuan ,    “  An puin a chhiahhlawhte hotu - ah leh an chaw sem huna semsak ṭhîntu atân sum enkawltu rinawm tak leh fing tak a ruat tûra chu tu nge ni ang  ?   
Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes . 	An pu lo kal huna bawih chutianga ti a rawn hmuh chu a nihlawh e .  
Truly I tell you ,  that he will set him over all that he has . 	Dik takin ka hrilh a che u ,  a neih zawng zawng chunga hotu - ah a rawn siam ang .  
But if that servant says in his heart ,   ' My lord delays his coming ,  '  and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants ,  and to eat and drink ,  and to be drunken , 	Amaherawhchu ,  bawih chuan ,   ‘ Ka pu hi a lo haw lawk dâwn lo ve , ’ ti rilruin bawih dangte chu a hmei a pain lo vêl sela ,  eiin lo rui buai hle mai sela ,  
then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn ' t expecting him ,  and in an hour that he doesn ' t know ,  and will cut him in two ,  and place his portion with the unfaithful . 	chu bawiha pu chu a rin loh ni - ah ,  a hriat loh dârah a lo kal ang a ,  bung hnihah a rawn chhuah ang a ,  mi rinawm lote chan a rawn chantîr ang .  
That servant ,  who knew his lord ' s will ,  and didn ' t prepare ,  nor do what he wanted ,  will be beaten with many stripes , 	Bawih ,  an pu duhzâwng hre reng chunga ti lo leh inpeih lo chu na taka vuak an ni ang .  
but he who didn ' t know ,  and did things worthy of stripes ,  will be beaten with few stripes .  To whoever much is given ,  of him will much be required ;  and to whom much was entrusted ,  of him more will be asked . 	Amaherawhchu ,  hriat loh avânga hremna khawp thil ti chu nêp deuhva vuak an ni ang .  Tam tak an pêk apiangte lakah chuan tam tak an phût ang ,  tam tak an kawltîr apiangte lakah tam tak an beisei ang . 
 " I came to throw fire on the earth .  I wish it were already kindled . 	  “  Khawvêlah mei chhuah tûra lo kal ka ni ,  tûnah pawh hian kâng tawh pang se ka va ti êm !  
But I have a baptism to be baptized with ,  and how distressed I am until it is accomplished ! 	Baptisma chan tûr pawh ka nei ,  chumi ka tlingtlâk hma chu ka thaw a va pik êm ! 
Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth  ?   I tell you ,  no ,  but rather division . 	Leiah hian rem lêntîr tûra lo kal emaw mi ti elo  ?   Hnai lo ve ,  ka hrilh a che u ,  do lêntîr tûra lo kal ka ni asin .  
For from now on ,  there will be five in one house divided ,  three against two ,  and two against three . 	Tûn hnuah chuan chhûng khata mi panga an indo vang a ,  pathumte chuan pahnihte chu an do vang a ,  pahnihten pathumte chu an do vang .  
They will be divided ,  father against son ,  and son against father ;  mother against daughter ,  and daughter against her mother ;  mother - in - law against her daughter - in - law ,  and daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law .  " 	Pain a fapa a do vang a ,  fapain a pa :  nuin a fanu a do vang a ,  fanuin a nu ;  nuin a mo a do vang a ,  movin a nu , ” a ti a . 
He said to the multitudes also ,   " When you see a cloud rising from the west ,  immediately you say ,   ' A shower is coming ,  '  and so it happens . 	Tin ,  mipui hnênah pawh chuan ,    “  Khawthlang lama chhûm lo chhuak in hmuhin ,   ‘ ruah a sûr dâwn e , ’ in ti nghâl ṭhîn a ,  a sûr ngei ṭhîn .  
When a south wind blows ,  you say ,   ' There will be a scorching heat ,  '  and it happens . 	Chhim thli a lo tleh lahin ,   ‘ khua a lum dâwn , ’ in ti a ,  a lum ngei ṭhîn .  
You hypocrites !  You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky ,  but how is it that you don ' t interpret this time  ?  	Nangni mi vervêkte u ,  lei leh vân enin khaw chin in hrethiam thei si a ,  engtizia nge tûnlai hun awm dân hi in hriatthiam theih loh  ?  
Why don ' t you judge for yourselves what is right  ?  	  “  A dik leh dik lo chu engati nge nangni pawhin in thliar mai loh  ?   
For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate ,  try diligently on the way to be released from him ,  lest perhaps he drag you to the judge ,  and the judge deliver you to the officer ,  and the officer throw you into prison . 	Thuneitu hmaa i khingpui nên in lan dâwnin ,  kal pahin a laka fihlîmna kawng zawng hrâm rawh ,  chuti lo chu rorêltu hmaah a hnûk lût hlauh dah ang che .  Rorêltu chuan pulis hnênah a hlân ang chia ,  pulis chuan tân inah a khung ang che .  
I tell you ,  you will by no means get out of there ,  until you have paid the very last penny .  " 	Ka hrilh a che u ,  pawisa pakhat tê pawh in tlâk kim hma chu chuta ta chu in chhuak tawp lo vang , ” a ti a . 
Abraham was old ,  and well stricken in age .  Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things . 	Abrahama chu a kum a lo tam a ,  a upa ta hle a ,  Lalpa chuan kawng tinrêngah Abrahama chu mal a sâwm a .  
Abraham said to his servant ,  the elder of his house ,  who ruled over all that he had ,   " Please put your hand under my thigh . 	Abrahama chuan a chhiahhlawh min ber ,  an chhûngkaw enkawltu hnênah ,    “  Ka malpui kârah i kut dah la ,  Lalpa ,  vân Pathian leh lei Pathian chhâlin chhia ka chhamtîr dâwn che a ni .  
I will make you swear by Yahweh ,  the God of heaven and the God of the earth ,  that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites ,  among whom I live . 	Ka chênna ram ,  Kanan nula zînga mi ,  ka fapa Isaka tân nupui i neihsak tûr a ni lo . 
But you shall go to my country ,  and to my relatives ,  and take a wife for my son Isaac .  " 	Ka pianna ramah i kal ang a ,  ka laichînte zîngah ,  ka fapa Isaka nupui i va zawng zâwk tûr a ni , ” a ti a .  
The servant said to him ,   " What if the woman isn ' t willing to follow me to this land  ?   Must I bring your son again to the land you came from  ?   " 	Chhiahhlawh chuan ,    “  Hmeichhia chuan he ramah hian min rawn zui duh lo sela ,  i fapa hi i lo kalna ramah chuan ka hruai kîr leh tûr em ni ang  ?  ” a ti a .  
Abraham said to him ,   " Beware that you don ' t bring my son there again . 	Abrahama chuan ,    “  Chu ramah chuan ka fapa hi i hruai kîr hauh tûr a ni lo .  
Yahweh ,  the God of heaven ,  who took me from my father ' s house ,  and from the land of my birth ,  who spoke to me ,  and who swore to me ,  saying ,   ' I will give this land to your seed .  '  He will send his angel before you ,  and you shall take a wife for my son from there . 	Lalpa vân Pathian chuan ka pa in leh lo ,  ka pianna ram aṭangin min hruai chhuak a ,   ‘ He ram hi i thlahte hnênah ka pe ang , ’ tiin a tiam tlat a ni .  Ani chuan i hmaah Vântirhkoh a tîr ang a ,  ka fapa nupui tûr i rawn hâwn thei mai ang .  
If the woman isn ' t willing to follow you ,  then you shall be clear from this my oath .  Only you shall not bring my son there again .  " 	Hmeichhia chuan a zui duh tlat loh che erawh chuan ka hnêna i chhechham lakah i fihlîm ang ;  eng pawh ni se ,  ka fapa hi chutah chuan i hruai kîr tûr a ni lo , ” a ti a .  
The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master ,  and swore to him concerning this matter . 	Tichuan ,  chhiahhlawh chuan a pu Abrahama malpui inkârah chuan a kut a dah a ,  chu thil thu - ah chuan a hmaah chhia a chham ta a .  
The servant took ten camels ,  of his master ' s camels ,  and departed ,  having a variety of good things of his master ' s with him .  He arose ,  and went to Mesopotamia ,  to the city of Nahor . 	Chhiahhlawh chuan a pu sanghâwngsei sâwm a hruai a ,  thilpêk tûr chi tinrêng a keng a ,  Nahora awmna khua Aram - Naharaim lam chu a pan ta a .
